"01","01","0","TREY","I'm your big brother. If I don't teach you this, who will? (He smashes the car window with a crowbar)"
"01","01","0","RYAN","I don't know, Trey."
"01","01","0","TREY","Quite being a little bitch, get in!"
"01","01","1","TREY","Yeah, let's go!"
"01","01","1","TREY","Get in! Come on, let's go Ryan!"
"01","01","2","RYAN","No, no, no, no, no!"
"01","01","4","SANDY","Ryan. Sandy Cohen. The court's appointed me your public defender."
"01","01","5","SANDY","You could do worse. You okay? They treating you all right?"
"01","01","5","RYAN","Where's my brother?"
"01","01","5","SANDY","Uh, Trey is over 18. Trey stole a car; Trey had a gun in his pants, an ounce of pot in his pocket, a couple of priors. I'm guessing right now, Trey's looking at three to five years. But Trey's not my concern. This is your first time in lockup. I'm assuming you don't plan on coming back. Your grades…are not great. Suspended twice for fighting, truancy three times…(hopeful) your test scores, 98 percentile on your SAT I? Ryan, 98 percentile, if you start going to class, are you thinking about college?"
"01","01","6","SANDY","Have you given any thought at all to your future? Dude. I'm on your side. Come on, help me out here."
"01","01","6","RYAN","Modern medicine is advancing to the point where the average human life span will be 100. But I read this article which said Social Security is supposed to run out by the year 2025, which means people are going to have to stay at their jobs until they're 80. So I don't want to commit to anything too soon."
"01","01","6","SANDY","(chuckles) Look, I can plead this down to a misdemeanor. Petty fine, probation. But know this; stealing a car ‘cause your big brother told you to, it's stupid, and it's weak, and those are two things you can't afford to be anymore."
"01","01","6","RYAN","Two more things."
"01","01","6","SANDY","Do you want to change that? Then you have to get over the fact that life dealt you a bad hand. I get it. We're cut from the same deck, Ryan. I grew up, no money, bad part of the Bronx. My father was gone; my mother worked all the time. I was pissed off. I was stupid."
"01","01","6","RYAN","And look at you now."
"01","01","6","SANDY","Smart kid like you. You got to have a plan. Some kind of a dream."
"01","01","6","RYAN","Yeah, right. Let me tell you something, okay? Where I'm from, having a dream doesn't make you smart. Knowing it won't come true…that does."
"01","01","7","SANDY","My office will contact you to remind you of the date for your hearing."
"01","01","7","RYAN","I'll remember."
"01","01","8","SANDY","Mrs. Atwood? I'm Sandy Cohen. I'm Ryan's attorney."
"01","01","8","SANDY","I'm going to give you my card. My home number. If you need somebody, if things get to be too much, call me."
"01","01","8","RYAN","(To his mom) All right!"
"01","01","9","RYAN","I'm sorry, Mom."
"01","01","9","RYAN","(desperate) But Mom…where am I going to go?"
"01","01","9","RYAN","Hey, this isn't your house, man."
"01","01","9","RYAN","Why don't you worry about your own kids, A.J? Instead of freeloading off my mom?"
"01","01","12","SANDY","Told you. You could do worse."
"01","01","13","RYAN","This is a nice car. I didn't know your kind of lawyer made money."
"01","01","13","SANDY","No, we don't. My wife does."
"01","01","14","SANDY","Um, you know, why don't you wait here for a minute? I'll be back."
"01","01","15","RYAN","It's no fun if the key's in the car."
"01","01","16","KIRSTEN","You brought him home? This is not a stray puppy, Sandy."
"01","01","16","SANDY","I know that, Kirsten."
"01","01","16","KIRSTEN","I knew it was only a matter of time before you started bringing home felons."
"01","01","16","SANDY","Ryan's not a felon."
"01","01","16","KIRSTEN","Did you not meet him in jail?"
"01","01","16","SANDY","Yes, technically, but it wasn't for a felony. I mean, it was, but it won't be when I'm done."
"01","01","16","KIRSTEN","You're endangering our home. Did you even think of Seth?"
"01","01","16","SANDY","It's only for the weekend. Just till Child Services opens on Monday…"
"01","01","16","KIRSTEN","What if this is all a scam? What if he's just using you to case the house?"
"01","01","16","SANDY","He's not a criminal mastermind. He's a kid who has no one and nowhere to go. When did you become so cynical?"
"01","01","16","KIRSTEN","When did you become so self-righteous?"
"01","01","16","SANDY","I've always been self-righteous. You used to find it charming."
"01","01","16","KIRSTEN","(walking away) He sleeps in the pool house."
"01","01","16","SANDY","Where are you going?"
"01","01","16","KIRSTEN","(dry sarcasm) To put my jewelry in the vault…where do you think I'm going? The boy's going to need fresh sheets and towels and a toothbrush."
"01","01","17","MARISSA","Who are you?"
"01","01","17","RYAN","Whoever you want me to be."
"01","01","17","MARISSA","Okay...Hey, can I bum a cigarette?"
"01","01","18","MARISSA","So, what are you doing here, seriously?"
"01","01","18","RYAN","Seriously? (truthfully) I stole a car. Crashed it. Actually, my brother did. Since he had a gun and drugs on him, he's in jail. I got out, and my mom threw me out. She was pissed off and drunk. So Mr. Cohen took me in."
"01","01","18","MARISSA","You're their cousin from Boston, right?"
"01","01","18","RYAN","Right…"
"01","01","18","SANDY","(walking towards them) Hi, Marissa."
"01","01","18","MARISSA","(drops cigarette) Hey, Mr. Cohen. I was just meeting your nephew."
"01","01","18","SANDY","Oh. My favorite nephew. Ryan. All the way from Seattle."
"01","01","18","MARISSA","Seattle?"
"01","01","18","RYAN","Dad lives there. Mom lives in Boston."
"01","01","18","MARISSA","Hmm."
"01","01","18","SANDY","So we're all really excited about your fashion show fund-raiser for tomorrow night."
"01","01","18","MARISSA","Really? You are?"
"01","01","18","SANDY","…No."
"01","01","19","LUKE","(to Marissa) Come on, let's go."
"01","01","19","MARISSA","(to Ryan) Hey, you should come by, check it out…if you don't have other plans. See you."
"01","01","19","SANDY","Good night."
"01","01","20","SANDY","Let's go inside. Uh, there's no smoking in this house."
"01","01","21","SANDY","So, this is where you'll be staying, and this is the queen of the manor herself, my wife Kirsten."
"01","01","21","KIRSTEN","Hello Ryan. Welcome to our home. If you need anything, Rosie here can help you."
"01","01","21","RYAN","Thank you. Thanks very much."
"01","01","21","SANDY","We'll see you in the morning. Make yourself comfortable."
"01","01","22","SETH","Hey."
"01","01","22","RYAN","Hey."
"01","01","22","SETH","Do you want to play?"
"01","01","23","SETH","Oh, looks like someone's trying to be a hero, but he got a little cocky. X O X O. It's an unbeatable combination. Oh! Oh! Oh…! What happened to your head, dude? Where did it go? I'm sorry. Did someone die? Oh, hey, do you want to play Grand Theft Auto? It's pretty cool. You can, like, steal cars and…not that that's cool…or uncool. I don't know. Um…"
"01","01","23","SANDY","I see you two have met. Seth, what are you doing inside on this beautiful day? Why don't you show Ryan around?"
"01","01","23","SETH","(sarcastically) Okay, ‘cause it's so great around here. There's so much to do, dad. (Turns to Ryan) I don't know, unless, what do you want to do?"
"01","01","23","RYAN","What do you guys do around here?"
"01","01","24","SETH","I have…this plan. Well, I don't-I don't know what you'd think but, next July, the trade winds shift west and I want to sail to Tahiti. I can do it in 44 days. Maybe even 42."
"01","01","24","RYAN","Wow. That…that sounds really cool, man."
"01","01","24","SETH","Yeah. Just hit the high seas and catch fish right off the side of the boat. Grill them right there. Just total quiet. Solitude."
"01","01","24","RYAN","You won't get lonely?"
"01","01","24","SETH","Well, I'll have Summer with me."
"01","01","24","RYAN","You're going to take this to Tahiti."
"01","01","24","SETH","(chuckles) Um…no. It's the girl the boat's named after."
"01","01","24","RYAN","She must be pretty stoked."
"01","01","24","SETH","Yeah, she has no idea. I've never talked to her before."
"01","01","25","SANDY","Hey, fellas. I thought we'd head over to the fashion show at about seven."
"01","01","25","SETH","Yeah, have fun."
"01","01","25","SANDY","Come on. It's a whole new school year, Seth."
"01","01","25","SETH","It's also the same kids, Dad. Why do they even need a fashion show? Every day's a fashion show for these people."
"01","01","25","SANDY","Yeah, well, Ryan has to go. Marissa invited him."
"01","01","25","SETH","(to Ryan) Marissa invited you? I've lived next door to Marissa since, like, forever. Her dad almost got married to my mom even and, like, she's never even invited me to a birthday."
"01","01","25","SANDY","That is not true. They did not almost get married."
"01","01","25","SETH","Eh."
"01","01","25","RYAN","Hey, maybe Summer would be there."
"01","01","26","MARISSA","My dad's not here."
"01","01","26","MARISSA","I don't know."
"01","01","27","JIMMY","Hey. Thanks, kiddo. I just didn't have time to deal with those guys right now."
"01","01","27","MARISSA","Who are they?"
"01","01","27","JIMMY","Suits. Bureaucrats. ""The Man."""
"01","01","27","MARISSA","But, I mean, everything's okay right?"
"01","01","27","JIMMY","Yeah, it's just a…just a thing with a…with a client. Nothing for you to worry about, okay?"
"01","01","28","SANDY","Wow, look at that. Fits you beautifully. Where's your tie?"
"01","01","28","RYAN","I'm not going to wear one. Open collar. It's a good look."
"01","01","28","SANDY","I didn't know how to tie a tie till I was 25. Come on. Give me your tie."
"01","01","29","SANDY","Button your top button. All right, collar up. Now, the skinny side has got to be shorter than the fat side. How much shorter, it changes tie to tie. Sometimes, it's just a mystery. All right. So you got to hang out with Seth. How was that? Was that…? Was that all right? He's an interesting kid if you get to know him."
"01","01","29","RYAN","He's cool."
"01","01","29","SANDY","Cool, huh? All right. There we go. (He finished fixing the tie) Turn around. Look at you. Huh? (Pats him on the shoulders) Beats a jumpsuit."
"01","01","30","JULIE","Oh, I love them, Caitlin. Do you like my hair this straight or is it too Avril Lavigne?"
"01","01","30","MARISSA","No, it looks good mom."
"01","01","30","JULIE","Oh, Marissa, you look…Oh honey, I thought you were going to wear your hair down. Pulled back like that, it's a little harsh on your angles."
"01","01","30","MARISSA","Okay. Let's go!"
"01","01","30","JULIE","It's going to be so amazing tonight. Are you going to wear the Donna Karan tonight, Mariss? I thought it was very forgiving."
"01","01","30","JIMMY","You look beautiful, Kiddo."
"01","01","32","SETH","(sarcastically) Welcome to the dark side."
"01","01","33","RYAN","Yes, you did."
"01","01","34","RYAN","Hi. Can I get a Seven and Seven? Thanks."
"01","01","35","KIRSTEN","Thank you. I want my husband to be right about you."
"01","01","36","SETH","Hey, Luke. What's up?"
"01","01","36","LUKE","Hey! Yeah. Suck it, queer."
"01","01","37","SETH","My vacation was great, too. Thank you for asking about it."
"01","01","38","SETH","Summer's right over there. Look. I'm sorry. Wait. Don't look don't look. But I mean you can look, but don't look like you're looking. (Sandy walks up) Hey dad."
"01","01","38","SANDY","Hey guys."
"01","01","39","SUMMER","Who is that?"
"01","01","39","MARISSA","Um, the cousin, the pool boy? (laughs) I don't know."
"01","01","39","SUMMER","Well, I'm going to find out."
"01","01","40","SANDY","Is that Summer?"
"01","01","40","SETH","You know, um, I'm going to, uh, sit. (walks away)"
"01","01","40","RYAN","Way to salt his game, Mr. Cohen."
"01","01","41","SETH","Hello, Chester. Are these seats taken? Okay."
"01","01","42","SETH","So, Chester, are you looking forward to your next sailing lesson? You're making some really good strides. (pause) Okay, I'm glad we had this little chance to catch up, you know?"
"01","01","42","MARISSA","(talking into microphone) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all so much for coming. Every year, we put on a fashion show to raise money for the battered women shelter. It's such a good cause, you guys, and we couldn't do any of it without your support and the support of Fashion Island and all their great stores. All right, enjoy the show!"
"01","01","43","SETH","She's got Tahiti written all over her. (moans)"
"01","01","45","SUMMER","Look what I stole."
"01","01","45","MARISSA","(holds up bottle of liquor) Look what I stole."
"01","01","45","SUMMER","(gasp) All right! Here."
"01","01","45","MARISSA","Thanks."
"01","01","46","KIRSTEN","She's so beautiful, you guys."
"01","01","46","SANDY","Coop, I think you spent more on that dress than I make in a year."
"01","01","46","SANDY","Well, you're bound to be half right."
"01","01","47","KIRSTEN","You okay, Jimmy?"
"01","01","47","JIMMY","Yeah. It's just uh, just…it's a little stuffy in here. I'm going to get some fresh air, okay? (gets up and leaves)"
"01","01","47","JULIE","Marissa wanted to wear these Prada Mary Janes, but I told her she had to wear the stiletto Manolos."
"01","01","48","SUMMER","Hey. Where you going? My friend, Holly…well, her parents are letting use their beach house as a gift, you know, ‘cause of all our hard work for charity. If you need a ride…or…anything. I'm Summer."
"01","01","49","SETH","Hey, you ready to go?"
"01","01","49","RYAN","Yeah. We should, uh, go to that party at that girl Holly's place."
"01","01","49","SETH","Uh, yeah, no, that's all right."
"01","01","49","RYAN","Summer…invited me."
"01","01","49","SETH","Really? She did?"
"01","01","49","RYAN","Us. She asked for you, actually."
"01","01","49","SETH","Really? She did?"
"01","01","49","SUMMER","(from the Jeep) Come on!"
"01","01","49","SETH","That makes absolutely no sense, but, yes, we should go. (He turns to the people he was talking to before) We're going to go with them. Thanks, guys."
"01","01","50","SETH","If it sucks, we can always bail…"
"01","01","51","RYAN","Welcome to the dark side."
"01","01","52","SETH","Oh, hey…cocaine. That's awesome."
"01","01","53","SUMMER","(huffs) Is that a new purse?"
"01","01","53","MARISSA","Yeah."
"01","01","53","SUMMER","Does you dad ever say no?"
"01","01","54","SUMMER","Hey…look who I brought."
"01","01","55","SUMMER","I'm going to play him hot and cold."
"01","01","56","SUMMER","You want to pee? I got to pee."
"01","01","57","LUKE","Yeah. Hey, you want to go check it out?"
"01","01","57","LUKE","Hmm? Oh, no worries."
"01","01","58","KIRSTEN","Hey, Jimmy."
"01","01","58","JIMMY","Hey."
"01","01","58","KIRSTEN","(to the dog) Hey Dusty."
"01","01","58","JIMMY","Dusty, look who's here."
"01","01","58","KIRSTEN","Are you really okay?"
"01","01","58","JIMMY","Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah."
"01","01","58","KIRSTEN","‘Cause you know, you can always…"
"01","01","58","JIMMY","No, you know, I've just been working really hard. So, who was that…that kid that…that you brought tonight? You have a cousin from Boston?"
"01","01","58","KIRSTEN","One of Sandy's clients. He…brought him home for the weekend."
"01","01","58","JIMMY","Uh huh."
"01","01","58","JULIE","Jimmy? Honey, did you get my fro yo?"
"01","01","58","JIMMY","(sighs) No. I forgot. (She looks expectantly at him) All right. I'll go back."
"01","01","58","JULIE","Pistachio. Thanks, sweetie. Hi Kirsten."
"01","01","59","JIMMY","You ever think this would be our lives?"
"01","01","59","KIRSTEN","Is Marissa back yet?"
"01","01","59","JIMMY","Oh, well, she usually stays out pretty late."
"01","01","59","KIRSTEN","Seth never goes out."
"01","01","59","JIMMY","Hmm, don't worry. Sure they're not doing anything we didn't do."
"01","01","59","KIRSTEN","Oh, that's comforting."
"01","01","60","SETH","Wow, I'm sorry. I should…really learn to knock incase there's a threesome going on in the bathroom. (He closes the door.)"
"01","01","62","MARISSA","Hey."
"01","01","62","RYAN","Hey."
"01","01","62","MARISSA","So, what do you think of Newport?"
"01","01","62","RYAN","I think I can get in less trouble where I'm from."
"01","01","62","MARISSA","(to Ryan) You have no idea. (She walks away)"
"01","01","63","SETH","I fixed the keg. Fine, more for me."
"01","01","64","SUMMER","Look…who I found."
"01","01","65","SUMMER","(laughing) Oops. I'm wasted. (She starts hanging onto him) So, what's your name anyway?"
"01","01","65","RYAN","Ryan."
"01","01","65","SETH","Ryan, you got to come um…what are you doing?"
"01","01","65","RYAN","(He tries to push Summer away) Hey um…"
"01","01","65","SUMMER","Excuse me?"
"01","01","65","SETH","What are you doing? I named my boat after her."
"01","01","65","SUMMER","(laughs) What? Eww…who are you?"
"01","01","65","RYAN","It's not what you think. She's a little bit drunk, okay?"
"01","01","65","SUMMER","Come on, Ryan."
"01","01","66","RYAN","Seth…Seth Seth!"
"01","01","67","SETH","Don't touch me! You know what? Why don't you go back to Chino? I'm sure there's a really nice car in the parking lot that you could steal."
"01","01","68","SUMMER","Chino? Eww."
"01","01","70","SETH","You guys really wouldn't hurt me, because that would be so clichéd. (They pick him up) I guess you're fans of the cliché."
"01","01","70","RYAN","Hey hey! Put him down! Put him down."
"01","01","70","SETH","(being held upside down) Hey Ryan. What's up?"
"01","01","70","RYAN","Put him down."
"01","01","70","LUKE","Hey, what's up, dude? You got a problem?"
"01","01","70","RYAN","You tell me."
"01","01","71","LUKE","Welcome to the O.C., bitch. This is how it's done in Orange County."
"01","01","72","SETH","Well, I…I don't know what to say…except that you totally had my back out there. We're, like, in a fight club or something. I don't know. You know what I think? Ryan, I think that if you were to teach me some moves, I think that we could totally take em next time. That's what I think. Give them some of that (kicks), you know what I'm saying? And a little bit of that and that (kicks twice). What do you think about that? (They clasp hands) Yeah. Oh also, that wasn't exactly the way that I first planned to talk to Summer, but I am now on her radar. Do you think I should tell her about Tahiti? Do you?"
"01","01","72","RYAN","Not yet."
"01","01","72","SETH","That's what I thought. That's what I was thinking. I wanted to make sure, we were on the same page."
"01","01","73","SETH","Quite a little night we had there. I'm not going to forget it. Ryan, I'm not going to forget that one."
"01","01","74","SUMMER","(giggling) I can't believe her."
"01","01","74","SUMMER","Shouldn't her boyfriend be doing this?"
"01","01","75","SUMMER","How are we going to find her keys? (She grabs Marissa's purse and starts digging through it) I can't find her keys."
"01","01","75","SUMMER","I know, I know."
"01","01","76","SUMMER","Bye, Coop. Call us."
"01","01","77","RYAN","(whispering) Hey. (He grabs her purse.) Get your keys."
"01","01","78","KIRSTEN","Thank God."
"01","01","79","KIRSTEN","What happened to your face?"
"01","01","79","SETH","Mm. I got into a fight."
"01","01","79","KIRSTEN","With who? Why?"
"01","01","79","SETH","I don't really know. I don't really remember. Um…I was really drunk. Yeah, I think I still am a little bit."
"01","01","79","KIRSTEN","Let's go. House. Now. (She drags him off the couch and to the door.)"
"01","01","79","SETH","Later!"
"01","01","80","SANDY","Oh, honey, you should have seen the waves coming in. Six foot, and it was going off."
"01","01","80","KIRSTEN","Seth got into a fight."
"01","01","80","SANDY","He did?"
"01","01","80","KIRSTEN","This is what happens when you let someone like this into our house. When we let out son hang out with criminals."
"01","01","80","SANDY","Well, at least he has someone to hang out with. Don't salt his game, honey."
"01","01","80","KIRSTEN","What the hell does that mean?"
"01","01","80","SANDY","I-I…It…I don't know. I just know that I'd rather have Seth hanging out with Ryan than some trust fund kid from around here who only cares about getting a new Beemer every year. There's a whole world outside this Newport Beach bubble."
"01","01","80","KIRSTEN","You don't seem to mind living in this bubble."
"01","01","80","SANDY","I know there's something else out there. You remember when we were 22? What'd you say? You said you'd never be like your parents. You'd never have their life."
"01","01","80","KIRSTEN","I was 22. I stank of patchouli and I lived in the back of a mail truck."
"01","01","80","SANDY","And you were fun. And rebellious, and…and…you married me."
"01","01","80","KIRSTEN","I can't. I'm sorry. I don't want this kid in my house anymore. (She walks back towards the house.)"
"01","01","80","SANDY","Where is he supposed to go?"
"01","01","80","KIRSTEN","He has a family, Sandy. It's not up to you to decide whether or not they're good enough."
"01","01","81","KIRSTEN","Look, Ryan, I don't mean to play bad cop. It's nothing personal…(Ryan walks over to the stove) is that bacon?"
"01","01","81","RYAN","I usually make breakfast at my house. My mom's not much of a cook, so…"
"01","01","81","KIRSTEN","I'm sorry. You seem like a really nice kid."
"01","01","81","RYAN","It's okay. I get it. (He walks over to get his things) You have a really nice family."
"01","01","82","RYAN","(knocks on wall) Hey, man."
"01","01","82","SETH","(turns over) Hey."
"01","01","82","RYAN","Hi. So…I gotta jet."
"01","01","82","SETH","You're leaving? So…hmm…so, what's up?"
"01","01","82","RYAN","I got to go back. Try to figure some stuff out back home."
"01","01","82","SETH","Okay Well…cool. Or…not cool, but, you know…what I think I mean."
"01","01","83","SETH","Come here. (Pulls Ryan into hug) I'll come down to Chino. You know, I'll visit you and you can show me your world. Or your hood or… (laughs)"
"01","01","83","RYAN","All right. (He turns to leave, but Seth stops him.)"
"01","01","83","SETH","Wait a second. Just wait one second. Hmm. (He walks over to his desk, grabs a map, and hands it to Ryan. We see that it's a map of the Pacific Ocean.) Maybe there's some place you want to go. It's pretty good for ideas."
"01","01","84","SETH","Ah!"
"01","01","85","RYAN","So, thanks. For everything."
"01","01","85","SANDY","(Reassuringly) I'm going to make sure everything works out, Ryan."
"01","01","86","RYAN","It's okay. I can take it from here."
"01","01","87","SANDY","Come on. Let's go."
"01","02","0","KIRSTEN","How was your swim?"
"01","02","1","RYAN","It was great."
"01","02","1","RYAN","looks at a model of a mansion that is on the kitchen counter."
"01","02","1","KIRSTEN","It's a model home. I build them."
"01","02","2","KIRSTEN","It's just a laugh riot around here."
"01","02","2","RYAN","This all looks really good."
"01","02","2","SETH","Yeah, it's too bad you're leaving."
"01","02","3","KIRSTEN","That's not true. I cook all the time."
"01","02","3","SETH","Dad??"
"01","02","3","SANDY","I'm sorry honey?"
"01","02","3","KIRSTEN","Let's just eat."
"01","02","3","SANDY","And we're not saying that we want you to cook more--"
"01","02","3","SETH","Oh, hell no, you remember that meatloaf incident of '98?"
"01","02","3","KIRSTEN","That was brisket."
"01","02","3","RYAN","is just watching them interact."
"01","02","3","SETH","Yeah, that's my point exactly."
"01","02","4","SANDY","As your attorney I'll cosign these forms. They basically say that you don't have a legal parent or guardian available."
"01","02","4","RYAN","I am now property of the government."
"01","02","5","SANDY","So we'll meet with your social worker in the morning and the--and she'll be the one to, uh to take you to the--to the group home. My contact at child services got you in with only two other kids, which is good. It can get crowded."
"01","02","5","RYAN","(unsure)Thanks. I appreciate it."
"01","02","5","SANDY","And you know, they do find foster home for kids your age."
"01","02","5","SETH","Yeah, because everyone wants a brand new teenager."
"01","02","5","SETH","(CONT'D)I'm sorry if I'm the only one here that will state the obvious-"
"01","02","5","SETH","--But we have all this extra room, right? We have a pool house. Yet you guys are going to ship him off to a group home. Am I the only one who gets how much that sucks?"
"01","02","6","KIRSTEN","looks guiltier than ever."
"01","02","6","SANDY","Goodnight."
"01","02","6","RYAN","exits towards the pool house."
"01","02","7","RYAN","can't sleep. He gets up and puts on his jeans."
"01","02","8","SETH","Hey, got a little Playstation, perhaps-uh, are you running away?"
"01","02","8","SETH","nods his head, hoping for approval."
"01","02","8","RYAN","No."
"01","02","8","SETH","Fair enough. Where you going?"
"01","02","8","RYAN","I don't know. New town, get a job somewhere. Save some money."
"01","02","8","SETH","(sarcastically)That's a great plan. Sounds like you've given it a lot of thought."
"01","02","8","RYAN","Got a better idea?"
"01","02","8","SETH","(realizing)Actually, I do."
"01","02","8","SETH","is dressed all in black and is putting items into a knapsack clumsily."
"01","02","8","SANDY","Hey, can I talk to you?"
"01","02","8","SETH","(groggily)Dad? What is it morning?"
"01","02","8","SANDY","(surprised)You were asleep?"
"01","02","8","SETH","Yeah, I was. What's going on?"
"01","02","8","SANDY","Well, uh, I wanted to talk about"
"01","02","8","RYAN","."
"01","02","8","SETH","Yeah, I know. It's cool. We don't need to discuss it."
"01","02","8","SANDY","Well, I think we, we do. I know you're upset. Your mother and I are upset. But our responsibility is to-is to our family."
"01","02","8","SETH","Yeah, it's okay. No, I get it. I mean, this is a person's life we're talking about and we need to leave it in the hands of the authorities."
"01","02","8","SANDY","(annoyed)There's no need for sarcasm."
"01","02","8","SETH","I'm not being sarcastic."
"01","02","8","SANDY","(contrite)It's hard to tell sometimes."
"01","02","8","SETH","Dad, it's okay, really?"
"01","02","8","SANDY","When you want to talk about it?"
"01","02","8","SETH","(hurriedly)Yeah, I know. You're the one to talk to."
"01","02","8","SETH","puts his head back under the covers."
"01","02","8","SETH","(CONT'D)Got it. 'Night."
"01","02","8","SANDY","Goodnight."
"01","02","8","SETH","Goodnight."
"01","02","10","MARISSA","Okay I got it. I'll be there in like 20 minutes."
"01","02","10","RYAN","Hey."
"01","02","10","MARISSA","Hey. I didn't think I'd see you again.(beat)Look, I wanted to say thanks. For the other night."
"01","02","10","RYAN","You always drink like that?"
"01","02","10","MARISSA","(changing subject)I thought you left."
"01","02","10","RYAN","Did. I am."
"01","02","11","SETH","(CONT'D)(louder)Hi there Marissa."
"01","02","11","MARISSA","What are you doing?"
"01","02","12","MARISSA","It's my friend Summer's birthday."
"01","02","12","SETH","(too quickly)Summer's birthday's not 'till Wednesday.(off her look)It's what I heard. I don't know."
"01","02","13","MARISSA","You guys are up to something."
"01","02","13","RYAN","I didn't tell her anything."
"01","02","14","SETH","Okay, I was going for stealth, and also, it's slimming. We should really go.(to Marissa)Have fun at your party."
"01","02","14","RYAN","(to Marissa)You should probably be off. The"
"01","02","15","MARISSA","Oh, yeah?"
"01","02","16","MARISSA","Why won't you tell me where you're going? This is pretty far away."
"01","02","16","SETH","Oh, wow, complaining. That's very interesting considering nobody invited you."
"01","02","16","MARISSA","Before I came you were on a skateboard."
"01","02","16","SETH","takes this as a huge insult."
"01","02","16","SETH","Oh! Oh!"
"01","02","16","RYAN","and Marissa look at each other. Marissa smiles. The radio is playing in the b.g."
"01","02","16","RYAN","Yeah, I guess."
"01","02","16","MARISSA","Well, what do you like?"
"01","02","16","RYAN","Everything. I-I don't know. I"
"01","02","17","SETH","Dude, that's kind of weird."
"01","02","17","RYAN","(to Marissa)Why? What do you like?"
"01","02","17","MARISSA","Uh, right now? Punk."
"01","02","17","SETH","I'm sorry, uh, Avril Lavigne doesn't count as punk."
"01","02","17","MARISSA","Oh yeah? Well what about The"
"01","02","18","SETH","I listen to the same music as"
"01","02","19","RYAN","(to Marissa)You listen to punk, huh?"
"01","02","19","MARISSA","(matter-of-factly)I'm angry."
"01","02","20","MARISSA","It looks scary."
"01","02","20","SETH","Well then you can stay in the"
"01","02","21","RYAN","(realizing)This isn't?"
"01","02","21","MARISSA","Where are we?"
"01","02","21","SETH","Well, it's one of my mom's housing developments. Her and my grandfather and a bunch of them."
"01","02","22","MARISSA","Why, did someone die here and now it's haunted?"
"01","02","22","SETH","(sarcastically)Yes that's exactly what happened."
"01","02","22","RYAN","What did happen?"
"01","02","22","SETH","I don't know."
"01","02","22","KIRSTEN","(O.S.)How do contractors just disappear?"
"01","02","23","SANDY","No luck with the contractors?"
"01","02","23","SANDY","I think so. Don't blame yourself."
"01","02","23","SANDY","I was talking about the contractors."
"01","02","23","KIRSTEN","smiles."
"01","02","24","MARISSA","So you want him to stay here?"
"01","02","24","RYAN","I haven't really had time to think."
"01","02","24","SETH","Well, how much better is this place than some group home. Hang on, and wait until you see the best part."
"01","02","24","SETH","open two doors to where an empty pool is and makes a noise that sounds like something from the 'Survivor' theme song."
"01","02","24","RYAN","(not so amazed)It's an empty pool"
"01","02","24","SETH","To some people."
"01","02","25","MARISSA","So your mom, I mean, she has to come back, right?"
"01","02","25","RYAN","I don't know. My mom's kind of a trainwreck."
"01","02","25","MARISSA","So's mine."
"01","02","25","MARISSA","Well, I mean, what about your dad? Can you call him?"
"01","02","25","RYAN","Dad's in jail. Armed robbery. Impressive, huh?"
"01","02","26","MARISSA","My dad is like a financial planner, and I"
"01","02","27","RYAN","I don't have any stock tips."
"01","02","27","MARISSA","He stopped going to the office and these guys keep showing up at the door but he won't answer.(beat)Look, I haven't told anybody that--"
"01","02","27","RYAN","I can keep a secret."
"01","02","28","MARISSA","(on phone)Hey!"
"01","02","29","LUKE","Where you at girl? It's time for you to get your buzz on. Nolan's so faded he can't even feel his feet."
"01","02","29","LUKE","I miss you babe. You know it's not a party without you."
"01","02","30","MARISSA","Aww, you're sweet."
"01","02","30","LUKE","(O.S.)What's the deal? I mean you were supposed to be here an hour ago."
"01","02","30","MARISSA","Okay, I'll be there soon.(beat)Say hi to everyone."
"01","02","30","LUKE","All right. Love you."
"01","02","31","MARISSA","(awkwardly)Love you too."
"01","02","31","RYAN","freezes for a moment having heard this."
"01","02","31","MARISSA","(CONT'D)Bye."
"01","02","32","RYAN","So, how long you been with him?"
"01","02","32","MARISSA","Luke? Um, I don't know really."
"01","02","32","SETH","I know. 5th grade, when you two got your mack on during our class trip to the Museum of Tolerance. Back of the bus."
"01","02","33","MARISSA","You know what? What's your problem Cohen?"
"01","02","34","SETH","Nothing Marissa. I've lived nextdoor to you forever and you've never done or said anything to me."
"01","02","34","MARISSA","Oh my god, you're the one who never talks to me. You think you're so much better than everyone."
"01","02","34","SETH","I do?(off her look)Well, if you're talking about Luke, then yes, because that guy shaves his chest!"
"01","02","34","RYAN","starts laughing."
"01","02","34","MARISSA","(defensively)He plays water polo."
"01","02","34","SETH","We know, half the team tried to kill us the other night."
"01","02","34","RYAN","(off Marissa's look)I'm not too popular around here. And your boyfriend? A little bit angry."
"01","02","34","MARISSA","And you're telling me you didn't try to hit him back?"
"01","02","34","RYAN","Actually, I hit him first."
"01","02","34","MARISSA","Wow, hard to believe you're not more popular."
"01","02","35","SETH","I thought this could be your room."
"01","02","35","RYAN","I still don't know if it's a good idea for me to sleep around or not."
"01","02","35","MARISSA","You should stay."
"01","02","36","RYAN","Okay. For a little while."
"01","02","36","SETH","So when she says it you listen?"
"01","02","37","MARISSA","(on phone)Hey Summer!"
"01","02","37","SETH","(whispering)Hey, hey hey that's Summer?"
"01","02","38","SETH","(CONT'D)Tell her I said Happy Birthday."
"01","02","39","SUMMER","Coop, where are you? I'm coming to get you."
"01","02","40","MARISSA","(on phone)Oh, no no no don't. I'm coming."
"01","02","40","SETH","(whispering- insistant)Tell her I said Happy Birthday!"
"01","02","40","SUMMER","Who?"
"01","02","41","MARISSA","(CONT'D)(on phone)Uh, look, I gotta go."
"01","02","41","MARISSA","(O.S.)Bye."
"01","02","42","MARISSA","I gotta go meet my friends(beat)My other friends."
"01","02","42","SETH","I should go with you and protect me cover, but wait... You have to promise not to tell anyone about this place, okay? Now"
"01","02","42","RYAN","'s not going to obviously, and I could get grounded. So that leaves... Marissa!"
"01","02","43","MARISSA","I can keep a secret."
"01","02","43","MARISSA","Me too! We'll fix this place up!"
"01","02","43","RYAN","Cool."
"01","03","0","SANDY","We got to stop meeting like this. Some good news. Kirsten's"
"01","03","1","RYAN","When's that?"
"01","03","1","SANDY","30 to 60 days. I could have you out sooner, if I could"
"01","03","2","RYAN","He gets to leave?"
"01","03","2","SANDY","Who? Luke? Well, according to both of you, the fire was an"
"01","03","3","RYAN","And he has someone to take him home."
"01","03","3","SANDY","Ryan, you know, if I could...It's going to be okay."
"01","03","3","RYAN","(scoffs) My mom ditched me. I burned your wife's house down."
"01","03","4","SANDY","We'll find your mother."
"01","03","4","RYAN","And what if we don't?"
"01","03","4","SANDY","We will do whatever it takes."
"01","03","4","RYAN","I mean, what if I don't want to find her?"
"01","03","4","SANDY","If only you'd come to me...instead of running away..."
"01","03","4","RYAN","Why? So I can end up in Child Services and foster care?"
"01","03","4","SANDY","You could have died in that fire."
"01","03","4","RYAN","Look...you've done more than enough. I can take care of"
"01","03","5","SANDY","We'll talk again before your hearing."
"01","03","5","RYAN","Tell your...wife...thanks."
"01","03","5","SANDY","Already did."
"01","03","6","RYAN","Sorry."
"01","03","7","KIRSTEN","Now all we need are the Bellinis...and can you make mine a"
"01","03","8","SANDY","Wow, you're all set up for your Newpsie convention. Hey, when"
"01","03","9","KIRSTEN","Soon...and I'm sure that I have a doily out of place"
"01","03","10","SANDY","Good. Gives 'em something to talk about. I don't know why you"
"01","03","11","KIRSTEN","I don't don't like them. I grew up with these women."
"01","03","12","SANDY","What's on the agenda? What event are you dragging me to this"
"01","03","13","KIRSTEN","Casino night."
"01","03","13","SANDY","You know this home-from-the-office housewife thing...It's"
"01","03","14","KIRSTEN","Disturbing?"
"01","03","14","SANDY","Hot. It's disturbingly hot."
"01","03","15","SANDY","Hey. Whatcha doing?"
"01","03","15","SETH","(He starts fixing himself cereal.) Nothing. I'm grounded."
"01","03","15","SANDY","Well, you're handling it well. You're lucky you're only"
"01","03","16","SETH","Can I see him?"
"01","03","16","SANDY","Ryan? No. There's nothing I can do for him right now."
"01","03","16","SETH","Yeah? You think he's okay?"
"01","03","16","SANDY","Well, there's a reason why I like to try to keep kids out of"
"01","03","17","SETH","And, you just...can't get him out, or you're just not a good"
"01","03","18","SANDY","My hands are tied unless I can find his mother."
"01","03","18","SETH","So, then, why can't he stay here?"
"01","03","18","KIRSTEN","I will not have this conversation again. (Turns away from"
"01","03","19","SETH","Yeah, well, if anything happens to Ryan, then it's all on"
"01","03","20","KIRSTEN","What I can't live with is if something was to happen to you"
"01","03","21","SETH","Like I meet someone who doesn't suck?"
"01","03","21","KIRSTEN","We are not his parents. I am not his mother."
"01","03","21","SETH","(starts to walk away) Good thing."
"01","03","21","SANDY","Hey! Get back here. Apologize."
"01","03","22","SANDY","Ladies."
"01","03","22","JULIE","Sandy, hi. How are you? (She kisses his cheek) Are you"
"01","03","23","SANDY","Yeah, temporarily."
"01","03","23","JULIE","Well, nobody blames you for bringing him into the community."
"01","03","25","JULIE","Oh, not this one--one of Kirsten's developments. Luckily, she"
"01","03","26","SANDY","Well, I should be off. Got to find the next kid to jeopardize"
"01","03","27","KIRSTEN","How about a Bellini?"
"01","03","29","JULIE","Well, I think it's an absolute embarrassment that the"
"01","03","30","JULIE","See, this is a travesty."
"01","03","31","KIRSTEN","I'll be right back. Um, I have to go uh...check on the"
"01","03","32","JULIE","She's been through so much. Her son...was friends with that"
"01","03","33","KIRSTEN","Where do you think you're going?"
"01","03","33","SETH","(sighs) What are you doing out here?"
"01","03","33","KIRSTEN","I'm taking a Newpsie break. Where are you going?"
"01","03","33","SETH","I'm not going anywhere."
"01","03","33","KIRSTEN","(Warningly) Seth."
"01","03","33","SETH","I'm going to juvie to visit Ryan."
"01","03","33","KIRSTEN","No, no you are not. No way."
"01","03","33","SETH","Okay, bye. (Turns to leave)"
"01","03","33","KIRSTEN","Seth. I know that I am not the perfect Carol Brady mom, but"
"01","03","34","SETH","I would like you to go with me."
"01","03","34","JULIE","(opens the door) Kirsten? Oh, there you are. We're talking"
"01","03","35","KIRSTEN","Sounds great. (Julie says okay and goes back inside) Give"
"01","03","36","SUMMER","Can I try this on?"
"01","03","36","MARISSA","Hey, Summer, my dad's home, you know."
"01","03","36","SUMMER","You say that like it's a bad thing."
"01","03","36","MARISSA","Oh, gross."
"01","03","36","SUMMER","Your dad's always home these days. What's up with that?"
"01","03","37","MARISSA","(into phone) Hey, Luke, it's me. I just...wanted to talk,"
"01","03","38","SUMMER","Still hasn't called you back? He was in lockup. Maybe he's"
"01","03","39","SUMMER","God, he loves you. He got in a fight and burnt a house down"
"01","03","40","MARISSA","How about talking to me?"
"01","03","40","SUMMER","Well, he'll get over it. He can't really think you're into"
"01","03","41","JIMMY","So...how's your mother?"
"01","03","41","SETH","Uh, just...married."
"01","03","41","JIMMY","(knocks on door) Marissa? You've got company."
"01","03","42","SETH","Oh, my god."
"01","03","42","JIMMY","Sorry. (Walks away)"
"01","03","42","SETH","(grinning widely) Uh...Hi, Summer. Um, um...I'm Seth Cohen. I"
"01","03","43","MARISSA","(closes the door to block Summer from Seth's view) What's"
"01","03","44","SETH","I...what? Yes, what is up. Uh...I'm going to visit Ryan. I"
"01","03","45","MARISSA","(speaking loudly) Uh, what's that, Seth? Did you say you"
"01","03","46","SETH","The Star Wars convention? I'm sorry. Her top was off. You"
"01","03","47","MARISSA","Look, I can't go with you. I can't see Ryan. I mean, Luke's"
"01","03","48","SETH","So what? Ryan's in jail. I thought we were all friends, and..."
"01","03","48","MARISSA","It's just...it's too complicated."
"01","03","48","SETH","To visit him?"
"01","03","48","MARISSA","I can't, okay?"
"01","03","48","SETH","Yeah. Fine. Whatever."
"01","03","49","KIRSTEN","Let's just make this quick, okay?"
"01","03","50","SETH","Hey. What happened to your neck?"
"01","03","50","RYAN","It's...nothing."
"01","03","50","SETH","You okay?"
"01","03","50","RYAN","Great."
"01","03","50","SETH","So, I'm sorry the plan didn't work. I thought I had it figured"
"01","03","52","SETH","So, Marissa seemed pretty weird when I tried to talk to her."
"01","03","53","RYAN","Hey, leave her alone."
"01","03","53","KIRSTEN","Ryan, it's okay."
"01","03","54","KIRSTEN","Seth, let's go. Now."
"01","03","54","SETH","Uh, guard."
"01","03","54","RYAN","Leave here alone."
"01","03","54","KIRSTEN","Seth, now!"
"01","03","54","KIRSTEN","Guards!"
"01","03","55","KIRSTEN","Guard!"
"01","03","58","SANDY","Seth...what did we say? No video games."
"01","03","59","SANDY","Oh."
"01","03","60","SANDY","I never knew you to be an impulse shopper."
"01","03","60","KIRSTEN","I didn't know what else to do."
"01","03","60","SANDY","Did you tell him it was permanent?"
"01","03","60","KIRSTEN","No, of course not."
"01","03","60","SANDY","'Cause we can't keep jerking this kid around, pulling him out"
"01","03","61","KIRSTEN","They were going to kill him in that place, Sandy. He"
"01","03","62","SANDY","He doesn't want to find her."
"01","03","62","KIRSTEN","He's a kid. He doesn't know what he wants."
"01","03","62","RYAN","(from behind them) So I guess I won't unpack."
"01","03","63","SETH","Hey."
"01","03","63","RYAN","Hey."
"01","03","63","SETH","Help yourself to a wide assortment of breakfast cereals."
"01","03","64","SETH","So, Ryan, what exactly happened that night with Marissa before"
"01","03","65","RYAN","She came to see me."
"01","03","65","SETH","And?"
"01","03","65","RYAN","And I told her to leave."
"01","03","65","SETH","You asked her to leave? That's it? You two up there all alone"
"01","03","66","RYAN","I thought I was taking off in the morning. It didn't seem"
"01","03","67","SETH","Well, I mean, you're still here. She lives next door."
"01","03","67","RYAN","I don't know. I said some things."
"01","03","67","SETH","So now's your chance to take it back."
"01","03","68","JULIE","Hey, I'm off. They're waiting for me in the ballroom. Those"
"01","03","69","MARISSA","No, thanks."
"01","03","69","JULIE","Marissa, honey, enough moping. It's very sweet that you're so"
"01","03","70","MARISSA","He's not in love with me."
"01","03","70","JULIE","Why not? He thinks he's too good for you?"
"01","03","70","MARISSA","Actually, he thinks I'm too good for him."
"01","03","70","JULIE","Well, he's right, but that's the past, and you need to focus"
"01","03","71","MARISSA","Okay. Thanks, mom."
"01","03","71","JULIE","It's what I'm here for. (She smiles and leaves)"
"01","03","72","KIRSTEN","I have to make some calls so if you could finish up in the"
"01","03","73","SANDY","(coming down the stairs) I got an early court date. I'm in"
"01","03","74","KIRSTEN","I have to set up for Casino Night. What about Ryan?"
"01","03","74","SANDY","I got two calls in to the private investigator about his"
"01","03","75","KIRSTEN","Yeah, but what am I supposed to do with him?"
"01","03","75","SANDY","Take him with you. Spend some time together."
"01","03","75","KIRSTEN","With all those women there?"
"01","03","75","SANDY","Sure, they'll love him. (He leaves)"
"01","03","76","KIRSTEN","Oh, hi, Julie."
"01","03","76","JULIE","Kirsten. Seth."
"01","03","76","KIRSTEN","Julie, this is Ryan."
"01","03","76","JULIE","I'm Julie Cooper. I've heard so much about you."
"01","03","76","RYAN","Nice to meet you, too."
"01","03","76","JULIE","There he is."
"01","03","77","LUKE","Hey, Mrs. Cooper."
"01","03","77","KIRSTEN","Thanks for coming."
"01","03","77","LUKE","Yeah, you know, anything I can do to help make amends for what"
"01","03","78","KIRSTEN","Ryan, I forgot that he was coming. If you want to..."
"01","03","78","RYAN","No, I'm here. How can I help?"
"01","03","78","JULIE","Well, now that we have our big strong, strapping men, time"
"01","03","79","MARISSA","Hey, I was hoping maybe we could talk."
"01","03","79","LUKE","Which one of us did you want to talk to? (He walks away)"
"01","03","79","MARISSA","Luke, come on. (After a moment, she too walks away.)"
"01","03","79","RYAN","I'm sorry. I feel like ever since I've gotten here, I screwed"
"01","03","80","MARISSA","No, I'm sorry. It's my fault, too. I mean, I never should"
"01","03","81","RYAN","I didn't..."
"01","03","81","MARISSA","You were right. We're from two different worlds. I'm glad"
"01","03","82","RYAN","Okay, what happened up at that house..."
"01","03","82","LUKE","I don't want to hear about it. You and I have nothing to say"
"01","03","83","KIRSTEN","Ok, boys. Uh, Ryan, why don't you come with me? New project."
"01","03","84","JULIE","How dare they? This boy is violent. He's a menace. I mean,"
"01","03","85","JULIE","All I know is that the police are taking criminals off the"
"01","03","86","JULIE","Who, Kirsten? She's never home. She's always working,"
"01","03","88","JULIE","I just hope she has a vault. And she keeps her jewels locked"
"01","03","89","SANDY","Hey, ladies. Care if I join you? Ooh. (He takes a piece of"
"01","03","90","JULIE","I...well, I hope you're not..."
"01","03","90","SANDY","Mad? Offended? No. I am disappointed. And frankly, I'm a"
"01","03","91","JULIE","Can I have a napkin...Now?"
"01","03","92","KIRSTEN","What am I supposed to do with 120,000 pounds of concrete?"
"01","03","93","RYAN","What do you do exactly? Real estate or construction?"
"01","03","93","SETH","Dude, don't ask."
"01","03","93","KIRSTEN","I tried to explain it to Seth once and he fell asleep half"
"01","03","94","SETH","Okay, but, uh...yeah, that's pretty much true."
"01","03","94","RYAN","Try me."
"01","03","95","KIRSTEN","My dad is in real estate development. He owns the Newport"
"01","03","96","RYAN","Wow, you guys built the mall, the Pacific Auditorium, baseball"
"01","03","97","KIRSTEN","Mm-hmm. And I'm in charge of residential development."
"01","03","97","RYAN","So, you deal with the contractors, the architects, planning"
"01","03","98","KIRSTEN","How did you know?"
"01","03","98","RYAN","I worked construction a couple summers. And I used to want to"
"01","03","99","KIRSTEN","What do you want to be now?"
"01","03","99","RYAN","17."
"01","03","99","KIRSTEN","(laughs) Me too."
"01","03","100","JIMMY","Hey, I thought you were setting up at the um..."
"01","03","101","KIRSTEN","You will not believe what Sandy Cohen said to me. He"
"01","03","102","JIMMY","Honey, you are from Riverside."
"01","03","102","JULIE","It was his tone. Compared me to that boy who started the"
"01","03","103","JIMMY","Leave Kirsten alone. She's the one paying our bills."
"01","03","103","JULIE","What are you talking about?"
"01","03","103","JIMMY","You know that...problem I was having at work? Well...she"
"01","03","104","JULIE","You went to Kirsten for a handout? Jimmy, how do you think"
"01","03","105","JIMMY","I really wouldn't call it a handout."
"01","03","105","JULIE","Oh, really? What would you call it?"
"01","03","105","JIMMY","(sighs) A hundred thousand dollars."
"01","03","107","SANDY","Dawn Atwood? Sandy Cohen, Ryan's attorney. I'd love to talk"
"01","03","108","SANDY","It'll only take a couple of minutes."
"01","03","109","SANDY","Why don't we grab a cup of coffee and talk about it."
"01","03","110","KIRSTEN","There are some great historical homes in the area and we"
"01","03","111","SETH","Yeah, those things are awesome."
"01","03","111","RYAN","Yeah, I'd like that."
"01","03","113","KIRSTEN","Thank you, Rosa."
"01","03","113","SANDY","No, thank you, Rosa."
"01","03","114","SANDY","So, Dawn, how long you been working at the laundromat?"
"01","03","114","RYAN","What happened to the restaurant?"
"01","03","114","RYAN","You got fired."
"01","03","115","RYAN","You seen Trey?"
"01","03","115","KIRSTEN","Where are you living these days?"
"01","03","115","KIRSTEN","Why don't you stay here tonight?"
"01","03","115","RYAN","What about A.J.?"
"01","03","116","RYAN","Mom?"
"01","03","117","RYAN","'Cause A.J. was the problem?"
"01","03","118","RYAN","It was bad enough living through it the first time."
"01","03","119","RYAN","What are you even doing here?"
"01","03","119","RYAN","Why? What do you want from me? You left a note. A note."
"01","03","119","RYAN","You abandoned me. You threw me out. You just took off."
"01","03","120","RYAN","That's what you said when we moved from Fresno after dad got"
"01","03","122","RYAN","Right. So, someone offers you a nice place to stay, and"
"01","03","124","RYAN","Wait."
"01","03","125","RYAN","Let's just go slow, okay?"
"01","03","126","SETH","So, where'd they go, anyways?"
"01","03","126","KIRSTEN","I don't know. Out."
"01","03","126","SETH","All right. So, we'll just wait for Happy Hour to end, and..."
"01","03","126","KIRSTEN","Seth, we need to be supportive. She seems like she's trying."
"01","03","126","SETH","Yeah, but how do you know? I mean, this woman abandoned him,"
"01","03","127","KIRSTEN","What do you want me to do? Invite her to stay so we can"
"01","03","128","SETH","Yes, that is exactly what I want you to do."
"01","03","130","RYAN","Not with all my clothes on."
"01","03","130","KIRSTEN","Welcome to my world."
"01","03","130","KIRSTEN","Actually, I was thinking. Uh...you just got here, you have"
"01","03","131","SETH","We're having a party tonight."
"01","03","131","KIRSTEN","Right."
"01","03","131","KIRSTEN","Vegas Night."
"01","03","132","KIRSTEN","(getting up) Oh, we'll find something."
"01","03","133","SANDY","Hey! Kirsten does the same thing--washes the dishes before"
"01","03","134","RYAN","We never had a dishwasher."
"01","03","134","SANDY","So, how's everything going?"
"01","03","134","RYAN","Okay, I guess. We had a good day."
"01","03","134","SANDY","You know, you being with your mother doesn't mean we're not"
"01","03","135","RYAN","She really likes it here. She talked about finding someplace"
"01","03","137","RYAN","Pretty much."
"01","03","137","JULIE","Kirsten! Another perfect event."
"01","03","137","SANDY","(to Jimmy) So, business is good?"
"01","03","137","JIMMY","Yeah, it's good. It's good."
"01","03","137","KIRSTEN","(to Julie) I love your dress."
"01","03","137","JULIE","You do? It's yours."
"01","03","137","KIRSTEN","Um...hi."
"01","03","138","SANDY","Would you like a drink?"
"01","03","138","KIRSTEN","I'd love one."
"01","03","139","KIRSTEN","Oh, thank you."
"01","03","139","JULIE","(to Jimmy) How much did you get for the hug?"
"01","03","140","RYAN","Betting kind of big, mom?"
"01","03","140","RYAN","You're counting? It's not a single deck."
"01","03","146","RYAN","Hey"
"01","03","146","MARISSA","Hi. So, is that your mom?"
"01","03","146","RYAN","Yeah."
"01","03","146","MARISSA","She came back, so I guess that means you're going home."
"01","03","146","RYAN","Yeah, I guess."
"01","03","146","MARISSA","Well, good luck with everything."
"01","03","146","RYAN","You too. Have a nice life."
"01","03","147","RYAN","You should go."
"01","03","148","SETH","Hi, Summer. Seth Cohen."
"01","03","148","SUMMER","I'm superstitious. Blow on these."
"01","03","148","SETH","What?"
"01","03","148","SUMMER","(holds out dice in her hand) Blow."
"01","03","149","SUMMER","My god! (Grabs dice) Do it again."
"01","03","150","SUMMER","(screams and pulls him towards the table) You're not going"
"01","03","151","SETH","Seth."
"01","03","151","SUMMER","Whatever."
"01","03","151","SETH","(happily) Okay."
"01","03","151","SUMMER","(holds out dice) Blow."
"01","03","152","MARISSA","You can't just not talk to me."
"01","03","152","LUKE","Watch me."
"01","03","153","MARISSA","It's not like you're totally innocent in all this. I mean,"
"01","03","154","LUKE","What was I supposed to do? You left me to go up there for him."
"01","03","154","MARISSA","It's not like that. It was a mistake."
"01","03","154","LUKE","Hell, yeah."
"01","03","155","JULIE","Hi, Sandy."
"01","03","155","SANDY","Hey, Julie."
"01","03","155","JULIE","I came to apologize and say thank you. The check that you"
"01","03","156","SANDY","It was our pleasure. You can't take it with you."
"01","03","157","LUKE","What do you want?"
"01","03","157","RYAN","Nothing happened...with Marissa and me."
"01","03","157","LUKE","Now, I don't want to talk about it."
"01","03","157","RYAN","No, listen. She chose you. You're the one she wants."
"01","03","159","JIMMY","Oh, you know what? How 'bout dessert?"
"01","03","159","KIRSTEN","(talking to Jimmy) We could...yeah, we could have a little"
"01","03","161","SUMMER","(hugs him) You rock, Stanley."
"01","03","161","SETH","(smiling) Oh...(blows on dice)"
"01","03","162","LUKE","Hey. Let's try again."
"01","03","165","KIRSTEN","Um, don't you think you've had enough?"
"01","03","166","KIRSTEN","Well, no one said it was going to be easy."
"01","03","166","SANDY","(walks up to Kirsten) Could we talk? It's important."
"01","03","166","KIRSTEN","Of course. Excuse us."
"01","03","167","JULIE","You want to hear something so funny?"
"01","03","167","JIMMY","Always."
"01","03","167","JULIE","Sandy Cohen had no idea Kirsten wrote you that check. Imagine"
"01","03","168","JIMMY","(gets up) All right, you know what?"
"01","03","168","JULIE","Who needs chips? You've got Kirsten."
"01","03","168","JIMMY","What'd you say to him?"
"01","03","168","JULIE","You don't even care how this makes me feel--that you went to"
"01","03","169","JIMMY","I didn't have any choice. You didn't want to talk about it. I"
"01","03","170","JULIE","Looks like we're not the only ones."
"01","03","171","SANDY","A hundred thousand dollars? It's more than I make in a year."
"01","03","172","KIRSTEN","It's just a loan. Of my money."
"01","03","172","SANDY","It's not the money. It's that you never told me."
"01","03","172","KIRSTEN","I know. I don't know why."
"01","03","172","SANDY","I've got a couple of ideas. Let me take you on a little"
"01","03","173","KIRSTEN","Sandy, I promise, it was just a loan. There's nothing more"
"01","03","174","SANDY","So what's your excuse?"
"01","03","174","JIMMY","(opens the door and walks over to them) Sandy, uh, I don't"
"01","03","175","SANDY","I'm trying to have a private conversation with my wife."
"01","03","176","SETH","Two Mountain Dews, my good man. Thank you, Ryan. Greatest"
"01","03","177","RYAN","High rolling. She was made for this place."
"01","03","177","SETH","Yeah? Then maybe this could work."
"01","03","177","RYAN","Yeah? Maybe."
"01","03","177","SUMMER","Rabbit's foot. Vamos nos."
"01","03","177","SETH","By the end of the night, she might know my first name. Duty"
"01","03","178","JIMMY","Look, I'm sorry."
"01","03","181","SETH","(to Summer) Here. Good luck. (He walks away to help.)"
"01","03","181","MARISSA","Hey, shut up."
"01","03","182","SANDY","(to Seth) Why don't you go get the car? (to Dawn) What, maybe"
"01","03","184","RYAN","Hey."
"01","04","0","SETH","(while absorbed with the game) Oh. Oh. (chuckles) Oh really? You think so?"
"01","04","0","RYAN","I do."
"01","04","0","SETH","Well, we'll see about that, Monkey Pox."
"01","04","0","SETH","So the pupil has become the teacher."
"01","04","1","SANDY","Hey guys!"
"01","04","1","RYAN","Hey."
"01","04","1","SETH","(unenthusiastically) Who died?"
"01","04","1","KIRSTEN","Seth, we need to talk to Ryan."
"01","04","2","SETH","Okay. If this has to do with the rug though, I just want to tell you that Ryan had nothing to do with it."
"01","04","2","KIRSTEN","(looking down at the rug) What about the rug?"
"01","04","2","SETH","I'm gonna go now. (leaves the room quickly as Kirsten is still looking at the rug)"
"01","04","3","SANDY","So, Kirsten and I went to child services this morning. And we told them that, uh, that we want you to stay with us. (Ryan looks very hopeful) But there's a catch. Because you're a minor, the only way they'll allow that to happen is if we assume all legal responsibility for you."
"01","04","3","RYAN","I can't ask you guys to do that."
"01","04","3","SANDY","Well, you don't have to. We're asking you."
"01","04","3","KIRSTEN","We've all talked about it. And we want to be your legal guardians. We want you to be part of the family. If you want to be..."
"01","04","3","RYAN","(looking a little uncertain) What if it doesn't work?"
"01","04","4","KIRSTEN","Well, how do you mean?"
"01","04","4","RYAN","Well... what if something happens and... and you guys change your mind."
"01","04","4","SANDY","Like what? You steal a car? You burn down a house? You beat up the captain of the water polo team? (both Sandy and Kirsten smile) Those ships have sailed, my friend."
"01","04","4","KIRSTEN","You just have to promise us you'll stay out of trouble. From now on... no more fights."
"01","04","4","SANDY","You're still on probation. And child services will be up our ass all the time."
"01","04","4","RYAN","(looking very grateful) No more trouble. I promise."
"01","04","5","SANDY","Well. (Ryan and Sandy stand up; Sandy extends his hand out to Ryan) Welcome to the family."
"01","04","6","RYAN","Thanks, guys"
"01","04","7","KIRSTEN","(loudly) Okay, Seth. You can come out now. (laughs)"
"01","04","8","RYAN","You knew about this and didn't say anything."
"01","04","8","SETH","(shrugging) I didn't want to jinx it."
"01","04","9","SETH","Dude. You're a Cohen now. Welcome to a life of insecurity and... paralysing self-doubt."
"01","04","9","RYAN","Yeah. (takes a deep breath) Now, all I have to do is... stay out of trouble."
"01","04","9","SETH","(nodding) Yeah, that could be... difficult."
"01","04","10","KIRSTEN","You're going to need bedding. And towels. Oh, how's the bed, Ryan? Is it comfortable?"
"01","04","11","RYAN","Yeah, it's - Huh. It's fine. It's great."
"01","04","11","KIRSTEN","(looking a little uncomfortable) We really want you to have your privacy, but this is a pool house - it needs a little warmth. You're going to need chairs, and a desk and a... bookshelf."
"01","04","11","SETH","Plasma flat screen, a couple of turntables, minibar -"
"01","04","11","KIRSTEN","(gesturing at a linen shelf) And we should clean all this out, so that you have room for some of your... Right, you don't have any stuff. Which means we have to go shopping for clothes and shoes and underpants..."
"01","04","11","SETH","Mom! Don't say underpants."
"01","04","11","RYAN","I've got everything I need. Really."
"01","04","11","KIRSTEN","I bet you don't have a tux. Cause you're going to need one."
"01","04","11","RYAN","For what?"
"01","04","11","KIRSTEN","For cotillion."
"01","04","12","KIRSTEN","It's the annual debutant ball. It's Newport's biggest event."
"01","04","12","SETH","Until whatever's next week."
"01","04","12","KIRSTEN","It's the day when Newport's most accomplished young women make their formal debut into society."
"01","04","12","SETH","Or another excuse for them to get wasted and throw up on themselves."
"01","04","12","KIRSTEN","Hey. I was a deb. I made my debut at this very country club not so many years ago."
"01","04","12","SETH","The year was -"
"01","04","12","KIRSTEN","Hey!"
"01","04","13","RYAN","You know what. Maybe I should skip it."
"01","04","13","KIRSTEN","You have to go. It's a family tradition and you're part of the family."
"01","04","14","KIRSTEN","Hi, Peggy. Mwah. How are you?"
"01","04","14","KIRSTEN","And how's it going?"
"01","04","14","KIRSTEN","Thank you. Come on, boys. It'll be fun."
"01","04","15","JIMMY","Sandy!"
"01","04","15","SANDY","Hey, Jimmy."
"01","04","16","JIMMY","Got some surfing in, huh?"
"01","04","16","SANDY","Yep. Late court date. Gotta take advantage."
"01","04","16","JIMMY","Nice to have hobbies. Look, uh... I know you're not thrilled with me. When I borrowed the money from Kirsten, I... should have... asked you. I wasn't - I wasn't going behind your back."
"01","04","16","SANDY","Look, it's done. Let's move on."
"01","04","16","JIMMY","I was, uh... I was afraid of what you'd think of me. (pause) Losing this much money as I have is, uh... not an impressive accomplishment. (looks very uncomfortable)"
"01","04","16","SANDY","How much money did you lose?"
"01","04","16","JIMMY","Ah. (waves it away) It's not important."
"01","04","16","SANDY","(nods. Then shakes his head) How'd you lose it?"
"01","04","16","JIMMY","Look. The important thing is - is I don't know what Julie and I would do without friends like you and Kirsten."
"01","04","17","SANDY","So everything's okay?"
"01","04","17","JIMMY","Oh yeah. Yeah. Thank you. (moves to leave)"
"01","04","17","SANDY","I'll see you around."
"01","04","17","JIMMY","See ya!"
"01","04","19","MARISSA","Hi. Uhm. I'm picking up for Marissa Cooper?"
"01","04","19","RYAN","Hey."
"01","04","19","MARISSA","(turns and sees him) Hey. What are *you* doing here?"
"01","04","19","RYAN","I, uh. (gestures at guy with measuring tape) I had an appointment with my personal shopper."
"01","04","19","MARISSA","But I thought you said you were leaving. With your mom."
"01","04","19","RYAN","It didn't really work out. So, I'm kind of living with the Cohens."
"01","04","19","MARISSA","For good?"
"01","04","19","RYAN","Is that... going to be a problem?"
"01","04","19","MARISSA","No. No! It's great. I mean, I guess now we can be friends, right?"
"01","04","20","SUMMER","(walks up) Hey, Coop! (removing gloves) Oh, these gloves are giving me serious sausage arms."
"01","04","21","LUKE","(to Ryan) What are you still doing here? I thought you were going back to Chino?"
"01","04","21","RYAN","I had a change of plans."
"01","04","21","MARISSA","Ryan is living here now."
"01","04","21","LUKE","He's WHAT?"
"01","04","21","RYAN","Look. I'm not here to cause problems."
"01","04","21","KIRSTEN","(walking up, looking concerned) Is everything all right?"
"01","04","22","LUKE","(to Marissa) I'll be in the truck. (starts leaving but not before sending Ryan one last 'look')"
"01","04","22","MARISSA","Great."
"01","04","22","KIRSTEN","Marissa. I was going to call you. Since you're lead deb, I - (turns behind) Seth! - I wanted to introduce you to a couple of white knights. In case any of your girls need a last minute escort."
"01","04","22","SUMMER","(licentiously) Every girl needs a white knight."
"01","04","23","SETH","(sidling up) Seth Cohen, white knight."
"01","04","23","SUMMER","(glances at Seth then focuses her attention on Ryan) So, uh, you'll be at the rehearsal."
"01","04","23","SETH","(nods enthusiastically at Summer then Ryan) Yes. Absolutely."
"01","04","23","SUMMER","(to Ryan) See you then. (drags Marissa away)"
"01","04","23","MARISSA","Bye."
"01","04","23","SETH","Cotillion ROCKS!"
"01","04","24","MARISSA","You want me to fix you up with RYAN? I mean I thought you said he was a 'total psycho.' (she supplies the finger quotes)"
"01","04","24","SUMMER","(holding up a dress to herself) Well, that was before I got to know him."
"01","04","24","MARISSA","Wait. When did you get to know him."
"01","04","24","SUMMER","Just now. Plus I'm into that whole brooding bad boy thing. He's wounded - I can save him."
"01","04","24","MARISSA","I mean have you really talked to him, though? Cause he's not really a bad boy."
"01","04","24","SUMMER","Well, he will be by the time I get through with him. (exchanges the dress she's holding for the one on Marissa's lap)"
"01","04","25","SUMMER","What? You're not like... into him are you? I mean, you're with Luke, right?"
"01","04","25","MARISSA","(a little too quickly) Right."
"01","04","25","SUMMER","Good."
"01","04","27","SANDY","(stands up) Okay."
"01","04","27","SANDY","Sure. What can I do for you?"
"01","04","27","SANDY","It wasn't an investment. It was a loan. My wife and Jimmy are old... (pauses) What's this about?"
"01","04","27","SANDY","(softly) No. (things clicking in his brain) No, I didn't."
"01","04","28","SETH","Hey. White gloves (to Ryan) are ready for a comeback."
"01","04","28","KIRSTEN","(walking into the kitchen, she sees Sandy pouring two glasses of red wine) Hey! What are you doing home?"
"01","04","28","SANDY","Fellas, do you mind?"
"01","04","28","SETH","Oh. Uh. If this is about the vase -"
"01","04","28","SANDY","Which vase?"
"01","04","28","SETH","Hm. (shakes his head) Nothing. Uh, let's go, Ryan. (jerks his head at Ryan) Come on, buddy."
"01","04","29","KIRSTEN","(walks up to Sandy, leans against the kitchen counter) What's going on?"
"01","04","30","RYAN","Okay. So... I think I'm not going to Cotillion."
"01","04","30","SETH","(sitting on a chair reading a comic book) Yeah, okay. Except that you are."
"01","04","30","RYAN","I made a promise to your parents that I'd stay out of trouble."
"01","04","30","SETH","Yeah, it's a debutant ball. What kind of trouble can you get into?"
"01","04","30","RYAN","I don't know. Why don't you ask *Luke*?"
"01","04","30","SETH","(sets down his comic book on his lap) Ryan. We're white knights, okay. That means Marissa probably already has some sad, lonely girl all lined up for you to escort, so you can't just call and cancel at the last minute. That's a faux pas, buddy."
"01","04","31","RYAN","Would you call her?"
"01","04","31","SETH","(looking up from his comics) No. (closes the comic again) If you're going to bail on Marissa and some like poor, pathetic dateless girl, you're just going to have to do that one yourself."
"01","04","32","KIRSTEN","(looking upset) Are you sure?"
"01","04","32","SANDY","Well, according to these guys, Jimmy's been siphoning money out of his clients' accounts to cover his own debts."
"01","04","32","KIRSTEN","(sits down on a chair, looks disbelieving) How could we not know something like this?"
"01","04","32","SANDY","Because. We trusted the guy. Everybody did. This entire community wrote him blank cheques and never asked any questions. *You* gave him a hundred grand!"
"01","04","32","KIRSTEN","It was just a loan."
"01","04","32","SANDY","WHICH according to the SEC makes us worth investigating too."
"01","04","32","KIRSTEN","(looking very upset, rests her forehead on her clasped hands) I'm going to be sick."
"01","04","32","SANDY","(picks up the cordless and turns it on) I'm going to have to call our friends and let 'em know."
"01","04","33","KIRSTEN","Sandy, wait. You're just going to panic people."
"01","04","34","KIRSTEN","Don't... do anything until I talk to him, okay?"
"01","04","34","SANDY","Put your personal feelings for this guy aside. Forget about your history -"
"01","04","34","KIRSTEN","He's one of my oldest friends. If it's true, I just need to hear it from him."
"01","04","35","MARISSA","I'm coming!"
"01","04","36","MARISSA","Hey!"
"01","04","37","MARISSA","You're, uhm, at my house. (she grabs her top, it looks like it's loose)"
"01","04","37","RYAN","I, uh, well, I wanted to talk to you about Cotillion."
"01","04","37","MARISSA","Oh. Okay. Well, uhm, (tries looking at her own back) I was just trying this on and I can't seem to reach the-"
"01","04","37","RYAN","Did you want me to, uhm - I could. Do you want me to, uh -"
"01","04","37","MARISSA","Yeah, you know, actually. (turns her back to him) If you wouldn't mind."
"01","04","38","MARISSA","(turning back) Thanks. So, what's up with Cotillion?"
"01","04","38","RYAN","What time did you want me there?"
"01","04","39","JIMMY","I'm, I'm so sorry. I never meant for you to be dragged in like this."
"01","04","39","KIRSTEN","How did this happen? I mean I understand a couple of bad investments, but theft -"
"01","04","39","JIMMY","(laughing) Theft? No, no, no!"
"01","04","39","JULIE","Okay, honey. So we're going get - (stops short as she enters the room and sees Kirsten) Oh, Kirsten."
"01","04","39","KIRSTEN","Julie."
"01","04","39","JULIE","Jimmy didn't tell me you were coming by."
"01","04","39","JIMMY","She just stopped by to ask a quick... business question."
"01","04","39","JULIE","A quickie, huh?"
"01","04","39","JIMMY","(unimpressed) Julie."
"01","04","39","JULIE","I'm kidding! So, we're off. Kaitlin needs new shoes for Cotillion. Then we're test-driving the CLK. And then I have to re-up Marissa's tennis lessons at the club, so which credit card should I use?"
"01","04","39","JIMMY","(looking harassed) Uh, the Mastercard."
"01","04","39","JULIE","What about the Amex?"
"01","04","40","JIMMY","Uh, no, don't use the Amex. We, uh, get the miles."
"01","04","40","JULIE","(softly) Okay. (leans forward to give Jimmy a quick kiss on the cheek, then turns to leave) You two have fun."
"01","04","40","JIMMY","(when Julie's gone) Well, now that the how and why have been accounted for. Look. I - I was not... *stealing*, I was - I was *borrowing* to pay back my debts and then the market took a turn and you know, I, uh - there we are."
"01","04","40","KIRSTEN","You were stealing."
"01","04","40","JIMMY","I - I can't say no... to my family. I'll pay everything back. I just need that one stock. That one stock -"
"01","04","40","KIRSTEN","Jimmy, you need help."
"01","04","40","JIMMY","(scoffs and looks defeated) Yeah, well, who's going to help me. (get up and turns away)"
"01","04","41","RYAN","So, uh, what exactly happens at this rehearsal?"
"01","04","41","SETH","Just, uh, stupid Cotillion stuff. Bowing, Curtsying..."
"01","04","42","RYAN","Dancing? You didn't tell me there was dancing."
"01","04","42","SETH","Well, if I told you there's dancing, I would be here by myself right now."
"01","04","42","RYAN","Because I really... don't... dance."
"01","04","42","SETH","Uh huh. Nether do I. I just move well. (does a really weird dance, then whispers) I'll teach you that one. Huh? Maybe later. You ready?"
"01","04","43","MARISSA","(talking to some couple, holding a clipboard) Take your places. (walking over to where Seth and Ryan are sitting) Hey guys. So, can I introduce you to your debs?"
"01","04","43","SUMMER","(sidling up to Ryan from behind) We've... already met."
"01","04","43","MARISSA","Oh well, actually, Summer, Ryan's already been promised to someone else."
"01","04","43","SUMMER","I can't believe this! You *gave* him to someone else? Who? Who's pathetic enough not to have a date the day before Cotillion?"
"01","04","43","ANNA","(coming up from behind Marissa) Actually, at this point, that would be you."
"01","04","43","MARISSA","So, Anna Stern. This is Ryan Atwood. Guys, Anna just moved here from Pittsburgh."
"01","04","43","SUMMER","Pittsburgh? Ew."
"01","04","43","ANNA","(looking a little uncomfortable) Can we just get this over with?"
"01","04","44","SETH","(to Ryan) Caliente."
"01","04","45","MARISSA","Hey, it's not that bad."
"01","04","45","RYAN","You haven't seen me dance. (grimaces)"
"01","04","45","MARISSA","Well, I can help you."
"01","04","46","SUMMER","(shouting after Marissa) So, like, what am *I* supposed to do?"
"01","04","46","SETH","(coughs) Over here."
"01","04","47","SUMMER","Fine! Let's go."
"01","04","47","SETH","(very excited) Are you sure? Because if, if, if you're not totally sure"
"01","04","47","SUMMER","Just! Don't. Talk to me."
"01","04","47","SETH","All right. I get it. Our - Our connection is a little bit deeper than words."
"01","04","48","SETH","That's it. I'm done. I'm sorry. A chockfull of quiet now. (offers his arms out to her meekly)"
"01","04","49","MARISSA","Okay. So you guys will be over here. (nudges Ryan onto the dance floor next to Anna) If you wanna go ahead and get into waltz position. (Anna and Ryan look completely lost) Which means Anna, you put your left hand on Ryan's shoulder."
"01","04","50","MARISSA","Uhm. No. Not like that. (nudges Anna aside and stands in front of Ryan) Here. Watch. (places her hand correct) Okay? Now, Ryan, you put your right hand on my back."
"01","04","51","MARISSA","(laughs) Lower."
"01","04","52","MARISSA","(looking suddenly uncomfortable) Okay. Good. Good."
"01","04","53","LUKE","I'd be pretty jealous right now. (Ryan and Marissa are still in position, but turn to look at him) If Chino wasn't gay."
"01","04","54","LUKE","What? No. It doesn't bother me. I mean he's born that way right."
"01","04","54","RYAN","(softly to Marissa, without looking at Luke) Thanks. I can take it from here."
"01","04","54","MARISSA","Okay. (gestures for Anna to return)"
"01","04","55","ANNA","(whistles lowly) You're into her, huh? (Ryan looks down at her) Man, are you in trouble."
"01","04","55","RYAN","(with resignation) I know."
"01","04","55","ANNA","Yeah. (lifts her arms) Come on."
"01","04","57","LUKE","(to Marissa) That kid is stalking you."
"01","04","57","MARISSA","He is not! He's my neighbour. And he's not going anywhere, so you're just going to have to get used to him."
"01","04","57","LUKE","What I'm never going to get used to is that kid macking on you every time I turn my back."
"01","04","57","MARISSA","So, you don't trust me?"
"01","04","58","LUKE","No. I... I don't trust anybody else. Not around you."
"01","04","59","ANNA","Wait. Are you the kid from Chino who steals cars and sets people's houses on fire?"
"01","04","60","ANNA","So, you're saying, I'm making my debut into society with Newport's most wanted?"
"01","04","60","RYAN","Is that going to be a problem?"
"01","04","60","ANNA","(smiles) I can't wait."
"01","04","61","SANDY","Absolutely NOT! As happy as I am that you came ALL the way out to my office to visit me. (walks around the table and gives Kirsten a kiss on the cheek) The answer is no. (calls out the door) Corey! I need that file on Nerodner vs. Caplin. And I, I do need that INS report on my four-thirty. (walks back to the other side of the table. Then to Kirsten) I got a two time drug offender they wanna deport. Fifteen years old."
"01","04","61","KIRSTEN","Sandy. He needs help."
"01","04","61","SANDY","Jimmy Cooper? He stole from his clients. He stole from his friends. And then he had the nerve to borrow a hundred thousand dollars from us to cover it up."
"01","04","61","KIRSTEN","He was trying to provide for his family!"
"01","04","61","SANDY","Yeah. Boats. Ponies."
"01","04","61","KIRSTEN","So, you'll defend a two-time drug offender, but you won't defend -"
"01","04","61","SANDY","Yes! My clients are kids. Who have no hope! No guidance. Nothing. (Kirsten turns her back to him) Jimmy Cooper is just another spoiled Newport brat (she turns back at this) who had everything handed to him."
"01","04","61","KIRSTEN","Like me?"
"01","04","61","SANDY","No. Not like you! *You* would never lie. *You* would never steal."
"01","04","61","KIRSTEN","I would like to think that. But the truth is - there isn't anything I wouldn't do for my family. (picks up her bag) See you at home."
"01","04","62","RYAN","(sounding exhausted) Three hours of dancing."
"01","04","62","SETH","(happily) I feel like I could go for three more."
"01","04","62","MARISSA","(coming out of the hall) Ryan! So, Anna seemed nice. I mean, I just figured - she's new and you're new, so..."
"01","04","62","RYAN","Yeah."
"01","04","62","MARISSA","Great. Good."
"01","04","63","MARISSA","Hey, Hol. I was just going to tell them about the cookout tonight."
"01","04","63","SETH","You didn't do it last year."
"01","04","63","SETH","(dawning upon him) Ouch."
"01","04","63","SETH","See you there!"
"01","04","63","RYAN","Uhm. You really think that's such a good idea. (looking at Luke who's talking to the guy from before)"
"01","04","63","MARISSA","Yeah. I do. I mean you're living here now and there's no reason we can't all hang out, right? (starts backing away, then turns and leaves)"
"01","04","63","SETH","(staring at Ryan) I can think of a reason."
"01","04","63","RYAN","Yeah. I'm not going."
"01","04","63","SETH","Wait. Dude, I don't want to go alone."
"01","04","63","RYAN","Summer's going to be there."
"01","04","63","SETH","Yeah. I'm still *going*, I'd just prefer not to go alone. Listen to me. We're like brothers now. (Ryan crosses his arms and listens intently) Okay? That means we do stuff for each other. For instance, if you do this for me, somewhere down the line, I'm going to be able to do something for you. I don't know what it's going to be yet, but it's going to be *awesome*! (Ryan looks unconvinced) Please?"
"01","04","66","JIMMY","Hey."
"01","04","66","JIMMY","Hey, Greg. Hey, Holly."
"01","04","66","JIMMY","(looking at bags) Somebody's having a party."
"01","04","66","JIMMY","That's right. Marissa's going. Have a good time. (walks away to the pick up station of the restaurant)"
"01","04","66","JIMMY","Hi. I'm picking up for, uh, Cooper."
"01","04","67","JIMMY","Oh yeah, I'm sorry. You know, work is - has been so crazy. But what's going on?"
"01","04","67","JIMMY","That sounds - That sounds promising."
"01","04","67","JIMMY","(looks flustered) Well, I... Are you sure you want to do that? I mean, uh, with the market about to turn around."
"01","04","67","JIMMY","Huh. Uh."
"01","04","68","JIMMY","Oh. Oh, it's a new care. You know, I forgot to activate it."
"01","04","69","JIMMY","(to waitress) Uhm. I'll just pay it with - I'll just pay it with cash."
"01","04","70","SETH","Give me ten minutes to find Summer. Lock it down for tomorrow. See where the night takes me."
"01","04","70","RYAN","It'd better take you right back here in ten minutes."
"01","04","70","SETH","(walking away) Okay. Don't wait up."
"01","04","71","SUMMER","Come on, Hol. I'll trade you two tickets to Jack Johnson, a massage at Burke-Williams and all the money I have on me (digs in her purse) which is... eleven dollars."
"01","04","71","SETH","(walking up to them) Hey, Summer. Holly."
"01","04","71","SUMMER","What did I say about talking to me?"
"01","04","71","SETH","Okay. I just - God - I just wanted to make sure that we're still on for tomorrow night."
"01","04","71","SUMMER","(in a pissy voice) I guess."
"01","04","71","SETH","(frustrated) Could you even pretend to be a little bit stoked?"
"01","04","72","SETH","Fair enough. (to Holly) Wow, you're a really good... barbeque-sionist."
"01","04","73","RYAN","So, you sure you want to be seen with me?"
"01","04","73","MARISSA","Hey. I'm glad you came. I mean how could you possibly miss all this?"
"01","04","74","RYAN","I'm going to go."
"01","04","74","MARISSA","Hey. We're not doing anything wrong."
"01","04","75","LUKE","Well, now that you've moved in, I see you're making yourself right at home."
"01","04","75","MARISSA","Luke, come on. You said you were going to try."
"01","04","75","LUKE","I'm trying. I - I'm trying to understand why there's all this people here and you only want to talk to her."
"01","04","75","MARISSA","Hey, I wanted to talk to him."
"01","04","75","LUKE","Look, babe, why don't you go talk to Summer, all right? She looks kind of lonely."
"01","04","75","MARISSA","Or you can. And I'll just stay and finish talking to Ryan."
"01","04","75","RYAN","It's okay. I'm just going to go."
"01","04","75","MARISSA","No. Stay."
"01","04","75","LUKE","(angrily) What are you doing? Don't tell him he can stay!"
"01","04","75","RYAN","Don't tell her what to do."
"01","04","75","LUKE","Thought you were leaving. (grabs Ryan's arm roughly) Why don't I just help you out?"
"01","04","76","RYAN","I'm not going to fight you."
"01","04","76","LUKE","(looks at him) Even if I do this? (punches Ryan in the gut)"
"01","04","77","MARISSA","(rushing forward) Luke! (crouches over Ryan) Oh my God! Are you okay? (stands up and advances on Luke) God. Luke. You're such an idiot."
"01","04","78","SETH","Wow. You just got your butt kicked. You didn't even fight back. Dude, you really are a Cohen. (Ryan glares at him, still clutching his tummy) Yeah. Let's just get you home."
"01","04","79","SETH","What are you doing? Why aren't you dressed yet?"
"01","04","79","RYAN","(not looking at Seth) I'm not going."
"01","04","80","RYAN","Will you let Anna know. She'd probably be relieved."
"01","04","80","SETH","Are you just not going to go because you're afraid of Luke?"
"01","04","80","RYAN","(still not looking up) That's not what I'm afraid of. (he looks up at Seth, who gives him a 'so what are you afraid of' look/hand gesture) Look. Your parents taking me in, it's like the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. I'm not going to lose it just to kick some guy's ass."
"01","04","80","SETH","But you could though. You could kick his ass, right?"
"01","04","80","RYAN","Oh yeah."
"01","04","80","SETH","Cool. (clears his throat) All right. Well. Have fun. (leaves)"
"01","04","81","JULIE","Sweetie, I need to borrow your lip-gloss. (stops when she sees the dress) Oh. I love this dress. (bends down to pick dress up)"
"01","04","81","MARISSA","Really. Maybe you should wear it."
"01","04","81","JULIE","Hah. You're sweet. (moves in front of the mirror, holding the dress in front of her) But I think we both know that I'm no longer a size zero. Give me a few more months on the zone."
"01","04","81","MARISSA","I don't think I want to go."
"01","04","81","JULIE","(turns to her immediately) I'm sorry. I thought I just heard you say you don't want to go to your own Cotillion."
"01","04","81","MARISSA","Look. Luke and I got in a fight last night, okay?"
"01","04","81","JULIE","(turning back to the mirror) So, you got into a fight. You've had fights before. You guys have been together forever."
"01","04","81","MARISSA","Maybe... that's the problem. (stops) I mean what if there's someone else out there?"
"01","04","81","JULIE","(looks scandalized) Like who? That boy from *Chino*?"
"01","04","82","JULIE","(lowering dress and walking towards Marissa) Marissa. Do you want to end up like your Aunt Cindy? With four kids in a trailer park? She broke my mother's heart. I will not let you break mine."
"01","04","82","MARISSA","Oh, so now this is about you?"
"01","04","82","JULIE","(softly) No, sweetie. It's about you. What kind of future do you think you could have with that boy?"
"01","04","82","MARISSA","Mom! I'm *sixteen*!"
"01","04","82","JULIE","And the choices that you make when you're sixteen can affect your entire future. Marissa, Luke comes from a good family. If you stay with him, you'll always be comfortable."
"01","04","82","MARISSA","I'm comfortable now!"
"01","04","82","JULIE","Nothing in life is certain."
"01","04","82","MARISSA","(taken aback) What does that mean?"
"01","04","82","JULIE","It means that you'll put on this dress, do your hair the way I showed you and make your debut into Newport's society with Luke."
"01","04","82","MARISSA","(sighs) I can't. (Julie looks livid) I'm sorry."
"01","04","82","JULIE","No, you're not. But you will be."
"01","04","83","KIRSTEN","What are you doing? Why aren't you dressed?"
"01","04","83","SANDY","I'm not going."
"01","04","83","KIRSTEN","What do you *mean* you're not going?"
"01","04","83","SANDY","Oh. I don't feel like getting all dressed up and having to pretend that Jimmy Cooper is the O.C. golden boy. Any community that makes that guy a hero is not one I feel like being a part of right now."
"01","04","84","KIRSTEN","(to Seth) You're not going either?"
"01","04","84","SETH","I wanted to leave twenty minutes ago."
"01","04","84","KIRSTEN","Let's go."
"01","04","84","SETH","Dad, why aren't you -"
"01","04","84","KIRSTEN","Seth! Now!"
"01","04","85","JIMMY","Oh, I don't know. Maybe I... shouldn't go either."
"01","04","85","JULIE","(very upset) What? What is wrong with this family? This is Cotillion. The most important event of the year. (looking on the verge of tears) Am I the only one who gets it?"
"01","04","86","KAITLIN","I get it, Mommy. (she's holding a cordless) Daddy, it's Mr Fisher again. He's called like three times."
"01","04","86","JULIE","(shaking her finger at Jimmy) No! We do not have time for you two to talk business. (to Kaitlin) Tell Greg, daddy will see him at the Cotillion. (to Jimmy) *Right*, Jimmy?"
"01","04","86","JIMMY","(sighing heavily) All right. Come on. (stands up) We're going to be late."
"01","04","87","SETH","Do you guys know Anna Stern?"
"01","04","88","ANNA","Seth!"
"01","04","89","SETH","Wow."
"01","04","89","ANNA","(excitedly) You think?"
"01","04","89","SETH","(walking up to her) Yes. I do. Which makes this... even harder to say. Anna, just know, that in life, there are peaks and -"
"01","04","89","ANNA","(disappointed) Ryan is not coming, is he?"
"01","04","89","SETH","You kind of took the wind out of my sails there, but yes."
"01","04","90","SETH","Are you okay?"
"01","04","90","ANNA","I'll survive."
"01","04","91","SANDY","Hey!"
"01","04","91","RYAN","Hey. Thought you were going to Cotillion?"
"01","04","91","SANDY","I thought you were."
"01","04","91","RYAN","Yeah... No."
"01","04","91","SANDY","(eats a chip) Yeah. Me neither."
"01","04","92","SANDY","Wait. Which one is sword?"
"01","04","92","RYAN","The one you're hitting."
"01","04","92","SANDY","Oh. Got it. Right."
"01","04","92","RYAN","Okay. Now you're stabbing me. Just don't touch any of the buttons. Follow me through the forest and, uh, maybe we'll both make it out of here alive."
"01","04","92","SANDY","So, you didn't feel like going, huh?"
"01","04","92","RYAN","(a little distracted by the game) Yeah... No. Not really for me."
"01","04","92","SANDY","What - Waltzing and orchids? What could be more you?"
"01","04","92","RYAN","Guess I don't really fit in, huh?"
"01","04","92","SANDY","Oh. I got news for you. Nobody does. I guarantee you, every single person at that Cotillion feels like a fraud. They've all got secrets and they're all terrified that the guy next door's going to find them out."
"01","04","92","RYAN","What's your secret?"
"01","04","92","SANDY","(shrugs) Sometimes, when the sun's coming up and the surf is good... and I haven't pissed my wife off quite as much as I have today, I kind of like this place."
"01","04","92","RYAN","(turns to look at him) You just stabbed me again."
"01","04","92","SANDY","Ooh. (looks at his controller) Sorry."
"01","04","93","SUMMER","I can't believe you're not coming."
"01","04","94","MARISSA","It's just... after the whole Luke and Ryan thing last night... (shrugs) I don't feel..."
"01","04","94","SUMMER","Coop. (softly) Ryan isn't even here."
"01","04","94","MARISSA","He's not? (recovers) Ah well, even so. I'm just not up for it."
"01","04","95","SUMMER","She's not coming."
"01","04","95","LUKE","So what did I get all dressed up for?"
"01","04","96","ANNA","I mean, whatever you think of the whole superhero movie genre, at least it's getting people to read the original source material."
"01","04","96","SETH","I can not believe that you read comic books. I... you're a girl!"
"01","04","96","ANNA","What is that supposed to mean? And I call them graphic novels. (Seth does a 'I know' gesture) In fact, if more people did maybe the form wouldn't be so marginalized."
"01","04","96","SETH","I couldn't agree more."
"01","04","97","SETH","Hey, Summer. You ready. You look just... great."
"01","04","97","SUMMER","So, listen, uhm. (looks uncomfortable)"
"01","04","97","SETH","You, uhm. You found another date."
"01","04","97","SUMMER","Yeah. It's kind of an emergency, but you're off the hook. Sorry."
"01","04","97","SETH","No, it's, it's, uhm -"
"01","04","98","SETH","(mumbling) It's fine."
"01","04","99","RYAN","Hey."
"01","04","99","MARISSA","Hey."
"01","04","99","RYAN","You - You're not at that Cotillion."
"01","04","99","MARISSA","Neither are you."
"01","04","100","MARISSA","Look. I hope you didn't not go because of last night or... because of me."
"01","04","100","RYAN","(doesn't quite know how to respond to that) How come you're not going?"
"01","04","101","RYAN","So, you think just hiding out, staying home, is going to make everything better?"
"01","04","101","MARISSA","Seems to be working for you. (then she gets a mischievous smile) I'll go if you go."
"01","04","102","SANDY","Ryan, come on! Check this out! I have totally annihilated all the other ninjas!"
"01","04","103","SANDY","I'm already on to the... (trails off when he sees Marissa) Marissa. Hello."
"01","04","103","MARISSA","Hey."
"01","04","103","RYAN","(looking nervous) So, we're going to go... to Cotillion."
"01","04","104","SANDY","Well, I'll get the car."
"01","04","105","JIMMY","Hey, Greg. How are you doing?"
"01","04","106","JIMMY","I don't have it."
"01","04","106","JIMMY","Look. This isn't really the time or place. Why don't you stop by the office tomorrow and we'll talk about it?"
"01","04","107","JIMMY","Excuse me. (takes off after Marissa)"
"01","04","108","JULIE","I don't believe it."
"01","04","109","LUKE","You told Summer you weren't coming. Now you're here with him!"
"01","04","109","MARISSA","No. Ryan and I aren't here together -"
"01","04","109","LUKE","(cutting her off) No. No. No! I'm not an idiot!"
"01","04","109","RYAN","(walking up to them) Then listen to her and stop acting like one."
"01","04","109","LUKE","What did you say?"
"01","04","109","RYAN","Look, I -"
"01","04","109","LUKE","No, no! (shoves Ryan in the chest, Marissa tries to placate him) What did you say!? Come on. Tell me what you said!"
"01","04","109","MARISSA","Stop it!"
"01","04","109","LUKE","(looking like he's going to cry) I'm over this. We're done. (takes off)"
"01","04","110","ANNA","Hey! Look who decided to show up. Oh, don't worry about it. Your hit man already took care of it. I didn't feel a thing!"
"01","04","110","RYAN","(looking sincerely sorry) I'm here now. If you want to, uh -"
"01","04","110","ANNA","(sniffles dramatically) No. Too late. You missed your shot. (looks at Marissa and Julie) I guess you'll have to go with Princess Mononoke over there."
"01","04","110","RYAN","What are you going to do?"
"01","04","110","ANNA","Oh, so *now* you care? (winks at him) Go!"
"01","04","110","JULIE","(to Marissa) Ugh, Marissa, if you'd just stuck to the original plan. (Marissa sighs) I'm sorry. Do you want me to have Daddy go find -"
"01","04","110","MARISSA","No, Mom!"
"01","04","110","JULIE","You can't make your debut without an escort."
"01","04","110","RYAN","(walking up) I hear there's a white night available."
"01","04","110","JULIE","(looking at Ryan condescendingly) Well, it's very nice of you to offer, but... I don't think it's appropriate."
"01","04","110","MARISSA","(smiles happily at Ryan, then declares) I'll go get dressed. (takes off)"
"01","04","111","ANNA","(walking up to him) Could you *be* any more pathetic? A lone figure, sitting on the floor, wondering if he's going to be lonely for the rest of his life."
"01","04","111","SETH","(gets up, crossing his arms in front of his chest defensively) Oh. Your sensitivity it's really, uh... non-existant."
"01","04","111","ANNA","(stalks up to him) You know what your problem is? You're not a man."
"01","04","111","SETH","(nods) Again. Not appreciating the brutal honesty."
"01","04","111","ANNA","Do you know what girls find sexy?"
"01","04","111","SETH","(sarcastically) Uh. Wait. Let me guess. Dudes who play water polo?"
"01","04","111","ANNA","Confidence! Watch this. (slides up real close to him) Seth."
"01","04","111","SETH","(nervously) Yes?"
"01","04","111","ANNA","I don't have a date to the Cotillion. Would you be my escort?"
"01","04","111","SETH","(totally nervous) I - I mean - I, uh -"
"01","04","111","ANNA","(brushing imaginary lint off his shoulder) Confidence, Cohen."
"01","04","111","SETH","(nods) Let's do this."
"01","04","112","JULIE","Hair's good. Make up's good. Very nice. Stand up straight. Gum please."
"01","04","113","SUMMER","How did this happen? How did I go from having three dates to Cotillion to having none?!"
"01","04","114","SUMMER","(walking up to Seth with a bright smile on her face) Good news! I'm available again!"
"01","04","114","SETH","You are."
"01","04","115","SETH","No. No. (does a weird dance) We're going to go this way. No."
"01","04","116","SANDY","Oh. Five hundred channels and nothing on."
"01","04","116","KIRSTEN","You couldn't put on a tux?"
"01","04","116","SANDY","Pick your battles, honey."
"01","04","118","MARISSA","Hey. (they walk up to each other) Are you ready to make your debut?"
"01","04","122","JIMMY","I love you, kiddo."
"01","04","122","MARISSA","I love you too, Daddy."
"01","04","124","JIMMY","Believe me. It's nothing that can't wait until tomorrow. (jerks his head at the dance floor) Don't the girls look beautiful?"
"01","04","124","RYAN","(softly to Marissa) I hate dancing."
"01","04","124","MARISSA","Wow. Thanks."
"01","04","124","RYAN","Oh no. Uhm. With you it's - it's (hey laugh nervously) not horrible."
"01","04","124","MARISSA","You're sweet."
"01","04","124","ANNA","(to Seth) Are you leading?"
"01","04","124","SETH","I'm trying."
"01","04","124","ANNA","Oooh. Attitude. I like that."
"01","04","125","JIMMY","Now. Is not the time."
"01","04","125","JIMMY","Look. I didn't want you to find out this way, but I don't have it."
"01","04","125","JIMMY","I will. But I don't have it right now."
"01","04","125","JIMMY","Shhh. Look. (pulls Greg away) I promise I'm working on it, all right? There's been some bad investments, some bad accounting -"
"01","04","125","JIMMY","All right. Will you just keep it down?"
"01","04","125","JIMMY","I'm sorry -"
"01","04","127","MARISSA","Oh my God!"
"01","04","129","SANDY","Leave. Now."
"01","04","130","MARISSA","(crouching over Jimmy) Dad."
"01","04","132","KIRSTEN","I haven't seen you in a fight since... never."
"01","04","132","SANDY","Now you know why."
"01","04","132","KIRSTEN","What are you talking about? He sucker punched you. You didn't have to jump in like that. Defend Jimmy."
"01","04","132","SANDY","Eh. I always had this thing for the underdog."
"01","04","133","SANDY","After I fill out the police report, maybe we should go over and see how he's doing."
"01","04","134","RYAN","(walking up to them) Hey. So, uh... sorry, I... I know I promised I wouldn't get into any fights."
"01","04","134","SANDY","I think we can make an exception in this case. (looks to Kirsten for confirmation. She smiles. Then to Ryan) The police, however, are going to have some questions. And as your attorney, I advice you - get out of here."
"01","04","134","RYAN","Thanks. (starts walking away)"
"01","04","134","SETH","(walking up to Ryan) Hey. Uhm. You don't mind if I walk your date home, do you?"
"01","04","135","RYAN","No."
"01","04","135","SETH","Cool. That's quite a little debut you had tonight. You really know how to present yourself. Finally, a Cohen who can throw it down. (pokes Ryan in the stomach. Ryan cringes) You want to come with us?"
"01","04","135","RYAN","(glances at Anna) Uh. I'll just see you at home."
"01","04","135","SETH","See you at home."
"01","04","136","SETH","So, do you think I, uh, could get to see you again?"
"01","04","136","ANNA","Mm. No."
"01","04","136","SETH","Well. Okay."
"01","04","136","ANNA","No. It's just. I know this might sound kind of... wha"
"01","05","0","RYAN","So, what are we doing in front of this tank?"
"01","05","0","SETH","Ryan, we're like two samurai, really. And we need to have respect for each other before meeting in battle. And eating lobster is a battle, as you will soon learn. (turns to glance at Ryan, then turns back to the tank ) Is that a new shirt?"
"01","05","1","RYAN","(looking down at his shirt) Yeah. Your mom bought me some new clothes. Which she didn't have to do."
"01","05","1","SETH","(sarcastically) Right. Because we all know you get a lot of mileage out of a tank top. Hey, (turns to Ryan) speaking of which, do you think I could pull of the wife beater? You know, switch up my look?"
"01","05","2","SETH","Gotcha. You got your style I got mine."
"01","05","2","RYAN","Yep."
"01","05","3","SETH","(making a 'you're dead' gesture with his index finger at the tank, whispering) You're dead."
"01","05","4","RYAN","That was amazing. A lot of work, but amazing."
"01","05","5","SETH","So, what's going on with you and Marissa? Did you talk to her?"
"01","05","5","RYAN","(sighing) I don't think she wants to talk. Everything with her and her dad is -"
"01","05","5","SETH","Ryan, you know what your problem is? And I speak from experience with *great* authority here - is that you really need to be aggressive, okay? Her and Luke - they're broken up - which means that you need to go after her. Tell her how you feel. It's very easy."
"01","05","5","RYAN","What do we do? Where do we go? I have no car. No money."
"01","05","6","SETH","I got it. Threw in a couple of sailing lessons this week. Feeling a little bit flush."
"01","05","6","RYAN","Not you too. I can't keep doing this. Ever since your parents took me in, they've been like *paying* for everything. I can't keep taking their money."
"01","05","6","SETH","They're parents. They work for us."
"01","05","6","RYAN","They're *your* parents."
"01","05","6","SETH","They're your guardians. It's the same principle."
"01","05","7","SETH","Okay. What are you going to do for cash then?"
"01","05","10","SETH","Fine. But you're going to hook me up with free lobster."
"01","05","11","SETH","This actually works out good for me. You starting the new job because now... I'm going to have time to do all the stuff that I haven't been able to do since you moved here. Like I'm going to get start my novel."
"01","05","11","RYAN","(walking by him, dressing) Be back by six."
"01","05","11","SETH","(looks at his watch) Yeah. I know. It's nine now, which means I'm going to have nine hours of me time. You know what I'm saying? For me, Ryan. I'm going to do stuff like learn Chinese. Study my Talmud. You know what I mean? Sink my teeth into it."
"01","05","11","RYAN","(grabbing his back pack) You going to be okay?"
"01","05","11","SETH","(taking a deep breath) Yes. Before you moved here, all I did was hang out by myself anyway. So it's really a return to form."
"01","05","12","KIRSTEN","Absolutely not. We've had this retreat on the books now for months. And Julie's looking forward to it."
"01","05","14","SETH","Uh Dad. What are you doing, man?"
"01","05","14","SANDY","(gesturing for Seth to be quiet, whispering) I'm waiting for them to disperse. (Seth tries to look into the kitchen, Sandy stops him) I left my briefcase in there. I - I need to get to work."
"01","05","14","RYAN","(softly) Well. Go get it."
"01","05","14","SANDY","And talk to those women? I can't."
"01","05","14","KIRSTEN","He didn't steal. It wasn't like - She's our friend."
"01","05","14","SETH","(mumbling) Those women are obsessed."
"01","05","14","SANDY","(still softly) Are you kidding? A scandal this big in a town this small? I mean, they'll be dining out on this for months!"
"01","05","14","RYAN","(to Sandy) Is that true? Is he going to jail?"
"01","05","14","SANDY","(shrugging) Jimmy Cooper stole a lot of money from a lot of powerful people."
"01","05","14","SETH","What's Marissa going to do without her dad?"
"01","05","15","JULIE","I don't want to go. I have to go. Trip's already been paid for. Besides, if I don't show up, those women will spend the entire weekend gossiping about me."
"01","05","16","JIMMY","You're being a little paranoid."
"01","05","16","JULIE","(scoffing) Oh no, I'm not. I'm sure they think I've mastermined this whole debacle."
"01","05","16","JIMMY","Honey. They're your friends."
"01","05","16","JULIE","Please. They're the gatekeepers of this entire community. The community your daughters and I would like to remain a part of? This is my one chance to go before the firing squad and plead for a stay of execution. (stalks off)"
"01","05","16","JIMMY","Well, I was hoping to be able to talk this weekend."
"01","05","16","JULIE","(stopping) This is your mess, Jimmy. You clean it up. And when I get back, we'll figure out what the hell we're going to tell our girls. (leaves the room)"
"01","05","17","SUMMER","Ugh! I'm totally crispy. (sighs) Let's go do something. Shopping? Get exfoliated? Anything."
"01","05","17","MARISSA","And I'll pay for it how? I mean, my dad's credit card got shut off yesterday."
"01","05","17","SUMMER","Well, what about Luke? I mean, he could pay for you. He *is* your boyfriend, right?"
"01","05","17","MARISSA","I don't know. (takes a deep breath) We left things kinda up in the air."
"01","05","17","SUMMER","You haven't talked to him since Cotillion?"
"01","05","17","MARISSA","I haven't talked to anyone. Except you."
"01","05","18","SUMMER","Okay, Coop. This is so not the way to handle this. I mean, you're going to become depressed. And then you're going to need medication. And then you're going to stop feeling like anything. (Marissa levels a look at her) According to my step mom."
"01","05","18","MARISSA","(smiling indulgently) Uh huh."
"01","05","18","SUMMER","Come on. Let me buy you lunch. My dad gave me his credit card in case of emergencies. And well, *this* is an emergency."
"01","05","19","MARISSA","Okay."
"01","05","23","RYAN","Been working here long?"
"01","05","25","RYAN","(to Marissa) Hey."
"01","05","25","MARISSA","Hey."
"01","05","25","RYAN","First day on the job."
"01","05","25","MARISSA","Oh. Wow. Well, the food here is... really good."
"01","05","26","RYAN","How's your dad?"
"01","05","26","MARISSA","He's okay."
"01","05","26","RYAN","How are you?"
"01","05","27","SUMMER","(from across the room, really loudly) Coop! Starving?"
"01","05","28","RYAN","Ah. I should get back to work."
"01","05","28","MARISSA","Right. (starts walking away)"
"01","05","28","RYAN","(really quickly) You want to hang out sometime?"
"01","05","29","RYAN","(looking nervous) Go out?"
"01","05","29","MARISSA","(smiling slightly) Like on a date?"
"01","05","29","RYAN","(too quickly) Not a date. Uh. Just... (like he's trying to find the words to stop sounding stupid)"
"01","05","29","MARISSA","I can't. Right now."
"01","05","29","RYAN","Of course. (looks disappointed) Right."
"01","05","29","MARISSA","But thanks. (tries smiling) See ya. (takes off)"
"01","05","30","SANDY","Hey, Jimmy."
"01","05","31","SANDY","How's it going?"
"01","05","31","JIMMY","Ah. (scoffs) Never better."
"01","05","31","SANDY","Listen, I was thinking. How would you like some free legal advice?"
"01","05","31","JIMMY","(a little confused) You want to be my lawyer? How long do you want to send me away for?"
"01","05","31","SANDY","I got way too big an ego for that."
"01","05","31","JIMMY","Oh. That's true."
"01","05","31","SANDY","No. I wouldn't be representing you. I've got a friend who is a securities attorney. But I could help you put together the case."
"01","05","31","JIMMY","(definitely confused) Why would you do that? You don't even like me."
"01","05","31","SANDY","Well... I'm a public defender. I represent a lot of people I don't like."
"01","05","32","SUMMER","(watching Ryan walk to the kitchen) I wish somebody'd told me he worked here now."
"01","05","32","MARISSA","Why?"
"01","05","32","SUMMER","(looking nervous and uncomfortable) No reason. (suddenly looks to the door) Oh! What do you know? Luke! What a coincidence! (totally fake with a nervous smile)"
"01","05","32","MARISSA","(upset) You invited him?"
"01","05","32","SUMMER","Got to pee! See ya! (grabs her bag and leaves)"
"01","05","32","MARISSA","Wait! Summer! (not loudly so as to not attract attention)"
"01","05","34","LUKE","Hey, babe."
"01","05","34","MARISSA","(smiling weakly) Hey."
"01","05","36","RYAN","You from Corona?"
"01","05","36","RYAN","(pointing to himself) Chino."
"01","05","37","MARISSA","So, I'm sorry I haven't called you back."
"01","05","37","LUKE","Ah, no. No worries. We don't have to talk about it."
"01","05","37","MARISSA","Maybe we *should* talk about it."
"01","05","37","LUKE","Why? Talking about stuff's just going to get us all bummed out. Let's just... Let's just *do* something."
"01","05","38","RYAN","Sounds like you're a fan."
"01","05","38","RYAN","Yeah?"
"01","05","39","RYAN","Cool. (looking kind of tired and unenthused as Donnie walks away)"
"01","05","39","LUKE","(leaning forward to Marissa) Holly's beach house. Party."
"01","05","39","MARISSA","(shakes her head) I don't really wanna."
"01","05","39","LUKE","Why not?"
"01","05","39","MARISSA","(a little loudly) It's weird! (then softly) I mean her - her dad beat up my dad at my debutant ball."
"01","05","39","LUKE","Yeah, well, you can't blame Holly for that! I mean, your dad stole all their money."
"01","05","39","MARISSA","(looking disgusted, gets up to leave) Nice."
"01","05","40","RYAN","(taking the cash offered to him) Thanks."
"01","05","40","RYAN","All right."
"01","05","41","SETH","Hey!"
"01","05","41","RYAN","What's up?"
"01","05","41","SETH","Craziest thing, uh, just happened. I was in the neighbourhood, checked my watch, it's six o'clock. I figured - come by and celebrate your first day on the job perhaps."
"01","05","41","RYAN","Yeah..."
"01","05","41","RYAN","Yeah. Yeah, actually, I made other plans. This is Donnie. He grew up in the town next to me. Uh, Donnie. Seth."
"01","05","41","SETH","Wow. Hey. What's up. Well, then. Wow. You guys must have a lot of catching up to do."
"01","05","41","SETH","Ah, yes. The ladies. I hear ya."
"01","05","41","RYAN","Well, uh, do you wanna - (turns to Donnie) Donnie, is it cool -"
"01","05","41","SETH","No no no no no no. Please, no. You guys, go. I - Cause I have to. I was going to do stuff. Uhm. But Donnie, hey, it's really good to meet you, man. (shakes Donnie's hand again)"
"01","05","41","RYAN","Yeah."
"01","05","41","SETH","See ya. So then, I'll just see you at home. Uh, tomorrow. Or tonight. Or just - I don't know - Just go."
"01","05","42","RYAN","(slowing down) You sure you don't want to -"
"01","05","42","SETH","No. No. Just - (waves him away)"
"01","05","42","RYAN","All right. (waves)"
"01","05","42","SETH","All right. (waves) Have fun."
"01","05","43","RYAN","What are you reading?"
"01","05","43","SETH","The new Legion came out Wednesday. It's part two of five."
"01","05","43","RYAN","I liked part one."
"01","05","43","SETH","Yeah. I'll let you borrow it when I'm done. (still not looking up)"
"01","05","44","RYAN","Thanks."
"01","05","44","SETH","How was last night?"
"01","05","44","RYAN","Fun."
"01","05","44","SETH","Cool. (Finally looking up at Ryan) That's cool that, you know, that you met someone that's where you're from. You know - it's just - you know, cool. (he tries waving it off like he doesn't care, then goes back to reading)"
"01","05","45","MARISSA","I mean, I know he's not the most sensitive guy in the world."
"01","05","45","SUMMER","No one wants to see you with Luke more than me. But what you're going through right now is gnarly. Luke's a boy. Maybe he can't handle it."
"01","05","46","SUMMER","(looking down at her own shoulder) Is it bad to burn on top of a peel?"
"01","05","46","MARISSA","(distracted, then looking briefly at Summer's shoulder) Uh. Yeah. Put thirty on it."
"01","05","46","SUMMER","Coop. Your life *will* stabilize. Your parents *will* work it out. Your mom will go away this weekend. They'll miss each other. They'll have make up s*x."
"01","05","46","MARISSA","(laughing) Ew! Summer!"
"01","05","46","SUMMER","(walking away) It's true!"
"01","05","46","RYAN","Marissa."
"01","05","47","RYAN","Hey."
"01","05","48","RYAN","Heading into the office."
"01","05","48","MARISSA","Yeah. Me too."
"01","05","49","RYAN","When I asked if you wanted to hang out, I was asking you out."
"01","05","49","MARISSA","(looking kind of happy) I know."
"01","05","49","RYAN","I just wanted to clear that up because I'm going to ask you out again. You want to do something tonight?"
"01","05","49","MARISSA","Well, I have to baby-sit for Kaitlin. But I will be cooking - macaroni and cheese. It's my specialty."
"01","05","49","RYAN","So, that's a yes."
"01","05","50","RYAN","All right."
"01","05","51","JIMMY","Won't these costs be covered by chapter eleven?"
"01","05","51","SANDY","Well, filing for bankruptcy isn't going to make this thing go away. The U.S. Attorney's office is involved in this now. They'll push for fraud and unauthorized transactions."
"01","05","51","JIMMY","Yeah, so, they fine me. And I go back to work. And I make it all back."
"01","05","51","SANDY","Four million dollars? Unless you plan on going to the track and getting *really* lucky..."
"01","05","51","JIMMY","Look. If you don't want to do this -"
"01","05","51","SANDY","You're going to lose your series seven license. (Jimmy looks stressed) It's really important that you understand the predicament you're in."
"01","05","51","JIMMY","Look. (fingers at the bridge of his nose, as if he has a really big headache) I get it from my wife every day. My daughters won't talk to me. I got my ass kicked in front of everyone at the most elegant event of the year. I get it. Okay, man. I, I, I definitely understand."
"01","05","51","SANDY","Well, look. We're both tired. Maybe we should take a break. Go out."
"01","05","51","JIMMY","Uh. What do you want to do?"
"01","05","51","SANDY","Well, our wives are away for the weekend. We could... Well, what did we do before we got married?"
"01","05","52","KIRSTEN","(messing with her Blackberry) I'm sorry. Put a bid in on a new development. The counter offer is outrageous."
"01","05","52","JULIE","(reading a magazine) She's lucky she has a career. (Kirsten turns to look at her) Well, I mean, it's not luck. You're very hard worker. (Kirsten looks back down) God knows I could use my own income right about now. Okay. Let's just say that I better enjoy the weekend because I won't be back for a while."
"01","05","52","JULIE","Who'd have known? (scoffing lightly) We have a deal. My domain is the kitchen and the bedroom, his is the office. I held up my end of the bargain."
"01","05","52","JULIE","Believe me. If I'd had known anything, I would have taken my girls out of the country. It's them I'm concerned about."
"01","05","53","JULIE","I mean, having to live with the shame of what your father's done?"
"01","05","53","KIRSTEN","(not looking up) Maybe we shouldn't talk about this."
"01","05","53","JULIE","(mildly) Oh no. I don't mind. I mean, to be honest, I blame myself. I feel like I should have known. Like... I should have sensed it somehow."
"01","05","53","JULIE","You're right. I know. It's just... (sighs) what else can I do?"
"01","05","53","KIRSTEN","Girls. This isn't helping Julie relax. Isn't that why we're here? (Julie gives her the evil eye)"
"01","05","54","SETH","Hey."
"01","05","54","RYAN","Hey."
"01","05","54","SETH","How do you feel about a little thing that I like to call... (whips out two tickets) the Imax Experience. This town sucks, best I could do."
"01","05","54","RYAN","Uh. I can't. I'm hanging out with Marissa tonight."
"01","05","54","SETH","So, we'll get a third ticket. I really don't think it's going to be sold out."
"01","05","54","RYAN","Well, she's got her sister."
"01","05","54","SETH","Fine. Four tickets then. I like Kaitlin - she's nice and she's smart for a fifth grader."
"01","05","54","RYAN","Actually, I, uh, was going to go over there. Help her... baby-sit."
"01","05","54","SETH","Ohhh. Nice. The baby-sit. I see. Stepping it up, taking it to the next level. I can respect that."
"01","05","54","RYAN","Yeah. (to Donnie, who is counting money behind him) Hey Donnie, I'm going to head out in a minute."
"01","05","54","RYAN","Uh. I got plans."
"01","05","55","SETH","I've got two tickets to the Imax, Donnie. It's a shark movie. Hear me out. It's very violent."
"01","05","55","SETH","You got a better idea?"
"01","05","55","SETH","Okay. Yes. That is better."
"01","05","55","SETH","(looks up hopefully) Uh. (Ryan hears the offer and looks over) Is that - is that cool?"
"01","05","55","SETH","All right. (Ryan walks up to Seth) I do enjoy the crazy honeys."
"01","05","55","RYAN","(blandly) You're not going."
"01","05","55","SETH","(laughing/scoffing) Okay, MOM. Except that I am."
"01","05","55","RYAN","It's... kind of a shady neighbourhood. It's pretty hard-core."
"01","05","55","SETH","Dude, it's Long Beach, not Chechnya."
"01","05","55","RYAN","Seth, guys like Donnie - you don't exactly know them and they don't exactly know... kids like you."
"01","05","55","SETH","(sarcastically) So, I shouldn't wear my ascot and talk about Grey Poupon?"
"01","05","55","RYAN","How're you going to get there?"
"01","05","55","SETH","I've got my mom's Range Rover. (Ryan gives him a 'oh really' look) What? I'll park it up the street. (Ryan looks unconvinced; Seth scoffs) Look. Donnie's a good guy, right? He's cool, right? So, maybe, this way, we can all be friends? We can all hang out."
"01","05","55","SETH","Yeah."
"01","05","55","RYAN","(seriously to Seth) We go for one hour."
"01","05","56","JIMMY","You know how long it's been since I've had a steak? I live with three vegetarians."
"01","05","56","SANDY","(takes a beer from Jimmy) Oh. You know how long it's been since we've had beer in the house? I'm so sick of Chardonnay and Merlot. (they clink bottles) Cheers."
"01","05","56","JIMMY","Cheers."
"01","05","57","SANDY","You want to grab that? These are almost done."
"01","05","57","JIMMY","Yeah. (goes into the house and picks up the phone) Hello?"
"01","05","58","KIRSTEN","(confused) Jimmy? Did I dial your number?"
"01","05","58","JIMMY","No, no, no. I'm at your place."
"01","05","58","KIRSTEN","Ohh. Working on the case."
"01","05","58","JIMMY","Well, uh, we're taking a break... actually."
"01","05","58","KIRSTEN","(in disbelief) With Sandy?"
"01","05","58","JIMMY","Yeah. We're doing, uh, doing guy stuff."
"01","05","58","KIRSTEN","Oh. All right. Well, uh, when you finish, uh, doing guy stuff, would you have Sandy give me a call? I just called to see if everything was okay. Is it?"
"01","05","58","JIMMY","Well, uh. (sighs) I guess. Uh, I don't know."
"01","05","58","KIRSTEN","You know, I've - I've been, really worried about you."
"01","05","58","JIMMY","Hmm. Thanks. (Julie is walking up behind Kirsten at the spa) I appreciate it."
"01","05","58","KIRSTEN","(not realising that Julie is standing behind her) Well, uh, I'll talk to you when I get back. Take care, Jimmy."
"01","05","59","JULIE","Your concern for my husband is REALLY touching. (walks away)"
"01","05","60","SETH","(pointing) She really is a dancer."
"01","05","61","RYAN","You have forty-five minutes. (walks towards Donnie)"
"01","05","61","SETH","Yeah. (totally engrossed in the stripping girl) We should see if she wants to come back to the pool house. (follows Ryan)"
"01","05","61","RYAN","Don't say pool house."
"01","05","61","SETH","Right."
"01","05","62","JIMMY","Oh, dude! I thought you said you played before?"
"01","05","62","SANDY","Well, some people have a natural talent. (punches the buttons, then lowers the controller in defeat) Not me."
"01","05","62","JIMMY","I haven't played videos games in like, I - I - I can't remember the last time I played. (still playing the game) Are we old? Because... if I didn't know better, I'd swear I was still sixteen."
"01","05","62","SANDY","Oh, I'm still twenty-two. Was the best year of my life."
"01","05","62","JIMMY","Yeah, uh, why twenty-two?"
"01","05","62","SANDY","That was when I met Kirsten."
"01","05","63","SANDY","Why sixteen?"
"01","05","63","JIMMY","Ah. It was when, uh... (pauses) *I* met Kirsten."
"01","05","64","MARISSA","(picking up phone) Hello?"
"01","05","64","RYAN","Marissa?"
"01","05","64","MARISSA","Hey. (covers one ear because the connection is noisy) Where are you?"
"01","05","66","RYAN","I got dragged to a party, but uhm, I'm leaving. I'm on my way. I just... got to get Seth away from, uh... this - this dancer."
"01","05","66","MARISSA","(curtly) Dancer?"
"01","05","66","RYAN","It's - It's a long story. But, uh, be there soon. (apologetically) Save me some mac and cheese?"
"01","05","66","MARISSA","(a little pissed off) Sure. See ya. (hangs up quickly)"
"01","05","67","RYAN","(grabs Seth's arm) Seth. We got to go."
"01","05","67","SETH","Whoa. Uh. Whoa. Uh. (turns back to the girls) One second. (pulls Ryan to the side) Hang on a second. All right, listen, I am really connecting with this girl, okay? Check it out. She just moved here with her sister from Uzbekistan and they're saving for a condo, right? Nice. That hits here. (he thumps his chest with his fist) Now, she does have a serious boyfriend. But you know what - she's looking to -"
"01","05","68","SETH","(turning to the girls) Good luck with the condo."
"01","05","70","SANDY","(disbelievingly) So, this all happened in the parking lot of the Imax movie theatre?"
"01","05","70","SETH","(with a dramatic 'I know' sigh) Shark movies bring out a rough crowd."
"01","05","71","SANDY","I'll call the insurance company, but you're explaining this to your mother. Tonight. (walks towards the house) Could get ugly."
"01","05","72","SETH","(softly) Yeah. (turning to Ryan) So, did you call Marissa?"
"01","05","72","RYAN","Tried her again this morning. She doesn't want to talk -"
"01","05","72","SETH","Man, I'm sorry I salted your game."
"01","05","72","RYAN","Yeah. (sadly) I got to get to work. (picks up his backpack, grabs his bike and takes off)"
"01","05","73","JULIE","(lack lustre) Thanks. That'd be great."
"01","05","73","KIRSTEN","(sitting down) Are you really considering a divorce?"
"01","05","73","JULIE","Why? You gonna call Jimmy and tell him?"
"01","05","73","KIRSTEN","I can't believe you're encouraging this, Karen. When your husband got caught with his assistant, no one gave you the number to a divorce attorney."
"01","05","73","KIRSTEN","No, what is uncalled for is your five hundred dollars a day coke habit in college."
"01","05","73","KIRSTEN","Oh, spare me. You have an entire Guatemalan family cleaning your house for less than minimum wage. (Pause) I have spent this entire weekend, listening to you women judge Jimmy. Yes, he made a mistake, a big one. But life is complicated and none of us is perfect, not even you, Julie."
"01","05","73","JULIE","(scandalized) And what is that supposed to mean?"
"01","05","73","KIRSTEN","He didn't buy ponies and jewellery for himself."
"01","05","73","JULIE","How interesting that you should take his side."
"01","05","73","KIRSTEN","He did all this for you because he wanted to give you everything. And now, you're just going to leave him."
"01","05","73","JULIE","He lied to me, Kirsten."
"01","05","73","KIRSTEN","(loudly) You lied to yourself! I know Jimmy."
"01","05","73","JULIE","I know. I've heard. He still has your prom photo up on our wall."
"01","05","73","KIRSTEN","(quieting down) It's all in the past."
"01","05","73","JULIE","(getting angrier) Really? You think it's a coincidence that we ended up living next door to you? (Kirsten looks stricken) I'm the one who married him. This is MY problem, not yours."
"01","05","74","JULIE","(turning back) Who knew that when he knocked me up that it'd be the best thing that ever happened to you."
"01","05","75","MARISSA","Uh. Hey."
"01","05","75","SETH","Hey. Uh, your dad let me in."
"01","05","76","SETH","He seems like he's doing better."
"01","05","76","MARISSA","(shrugging uncomfortably) Yeah, I guess."
"01","05","77","SETH","(pointing at the cell) You going to get that?"
"01","05","77","MARISSA","Oh, it's probably just Summer calling about another party at Holly's. (picks up the cell phone and turns it off)"
"01","05","77","SETH","Ah yes, another one of those."
"01","05","77","MARISSA","(dumps the phone on her bed, then turns back, crosses her arms in front of her chest and says with fake cheer) So, how did it go with the dancer?"
"01","05","77","SETH","Uhm. Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. (Walks up to her) Last night - was totally my fault. Okay? Ryan was extremely bummed that he didn't get to make his blockbuster night. And I know that you're going through a lot right now and the last thing you needed was to get stood up, so... I apologize."
"01","05","77","MARISSA","Well, that's very... thoughtful. (uncrosses her arms)"
"01","05","77","SETH","Yeah, well. He's pretty mad at me right now. So, why don't you help a brother out? How about another date? (Marissa looks uncertain) Hmm? He's a good cook."
"01","05","78","JIMMY","(looking at his ball take down the fairway) I tell ya. One good swing and I love this game."
"01","05","78","SANDY","Nice drive. (places his ball) So, I talked to my friend the securities attorney this morning."
"01","05","78","JIMMY","Working on the weekend."
"01","05","78","SANDY","Working for you to keep you out of jail. And he's pretty sure he's going to be able to make that happen."
"01","05","78","JIMMY","Excellent."
"01","05","78","SANDY","It's contingent on you making full restitution. You're going to lose your series seven license and you'll never be allowed near another investment account. But... little or no jail time. (lines up his shot)"
"01","05","78","JIMMY","So, I got to pay back everything I lost."
"01","05","78","SANDY","(stands up straight from his swinging position) And even then, there are no guarantees. (Jimmy looks restless) But it's your only option."
"01","05","78","JIMMY","(pacing) Yeah, well, that's - that's - that's not an option. Where in the hell am I going to find four million dollars?"
"01","05","78","SANDY","Well, your house is valued at three point two, you got two six in equity. That's a good start."
"01","05","78","JIMMY","You want me to sell my house? Julie will - she'll leave me."
"01","05","78","SANDY","Julie cares about you and the kids. She's not going to care about giving up the house if it means keeping you."
"01","05","78","JIMMY","Whose wife are we talking about? (Sandy looks up at him) No. We gotta - We gotta come up with something else."
"01","05","78","SANDY","This is it. This is a gift. Be grateful."
"01","05","78","JIMMY","Grateful?"
"01","05","78","SANDY","What - Did you think it was just going to go away? That there were going to be no consequences? You got to get real."
"01","05","78","JIMMY","Hey! Who are YOU to tell ME to get real? You - You live in a fantasyland. You're married to the richest girl in the county. You live in a house you've never paid for! (gets up in Sandy's face) You get fired? Kirsten wouldn't even notice it! You have no idea what it's like to provide for a family! (turns away angrily)"
"01","05","78","SANDY","I think there's more to providing for a family than money. You want to be there when Marissa graduates? You want to watch Kaitlin grow up? You can start over. You can start a new life."
"01","05","78","JIMMY","I don't want a new life. I want - I want my old one back. (scoffs) But I guess that's not going to happen, huh?"
"01","05","79","RYAN","Hey. What's up?"
"01","05","79","SETH","Seth Cohen. Your friendly neighbourhood pimp, at your service. I had a little conversation with Marissa, it's totally handled. (hangs back while Ryan puts down the plates of food)"
"01","05","79","RYAN","(to the girls) I'll be right back with your drinks. (walking back past Seth) What are you talking about?"
"01","05","79","SETH","(following Ryan) Well, it turns out that I'm quite skilled at getting a date, provided it's not for me. You're going to have the house to yourself, she's going to coming over shortly and you will be cooking."
"01","05","80","SETH","Hey."
"01","05","80","SETH","Not really. No."
"01","05","80","SETH","There's a lame beach party, typical Newport scene."
"01","05","80","SETH","No. It's not for me. It's going to be a bunch of water polo guys and their girlfriends."
"01","05","80","SETH","Nor do I. Just a bunch of dudes who enjoy wearing Speedos."
"01","05","80","SETH","I couldn't agree more."
"01","05","80","SETH","(pauses) That's very wise, Donnie."
"01","05","81","SETH","All right."
"01","05","81","SETH","All right."
"01","05","82","SETH","(turning and scoffing lightly) Enough with the whole moody scowl thing. Please. It's not a big deal."
"01","05","82","RYAN","You're going to take him to a Newport party?"
"01","05","82","SETH","Yeah, exactly. Now it'll be on my turf. (pauses) Actually, I don't really have any turf, but if I had turf - this would be it. And not only that, Summer's going to be there."
"01","05","82","RYAN","(looking worried) I don't know about this, Seth -"
"01","05","82","SETH","I do, okay? It's fine. It is not a big deal. I promise. Now... you got a date, okay? So, you have to go. (Ryan still looks worried) Make me proud. (Ryan gives up and walks away) Put a sock on the door!"
"01","05","83","MARISSA","Hey! I brought you some leftovers."
"01","05","83","RYAN","(looking over his shoulder) Should go well with grilled cheese. (Marissa walks up and looks over his shoulder at the food, then smiles happily) My specialty."
"01","05","83","MARISSA","Ooooh. Very fancy."
"01","05","83","RYAN","Hey... don't knock it till you try it. (puts two sandwiches on a plate) Dinner is served."
"01","05","84","SETH","Kind of lame right."
"01","05","85","LUKE","She's at home. We're, uh, we're sort of taking a break."
"01","05","86","MARISSA","Mmm. That was the best grilled cheese ever. (wipes her hands on a napkin)"
"01","05","86","RYAN","Yeah. Well, your mac and cheese was pretty good too."
"01","05","86","MARISSA","(laughing) Yeah. Well, it tasted better last night."
"01","05","87","RYAN","Yeah!"
"01","05","87","MARISSA","Hey!"
"01","05","88","RYAN","But then, hey, we're hanging out, right?"
"01","05","88","MARISSA","Yeah. I'm glad. We are."
"01","05","88","RYAN","So, how are you? With everything."
"01","05","88","MARISSA","I'm okay, I guess. I mean, I still don't know what's going to happen. My parents are fighting all the time. My family's not perfect - not even close - but... I just... don't want us to fall apart."
"01","05","89","RYAN","Let's do something fun. You still have fun, right?"
"01","05","89","MARISSA","I don't know."
"01","05","89","RYAN","(leaning up behind her and whispering) What if you don't have a choice?"
"01","05","89","MARISSA","(laughing) What does that mean?"
"01","05","90","MARISSA","(giggling) No, no! Stop! (he lets her go, she's still laughing) Okay."
"01","05","91","RYAN","I'm taking you with me."
"01","05","92","SUMMER","(backing away slightly) Not with you."

"01","05","98","MARISSA","Now can I borrow one of your tank tops so I can look as cool as you?"
"01","05","98","RYAN","Oh yeah? (grabs the towel around her and pulls her close so that their foreheads are touching) You want to go back in the pool?"
"01","05","99","MARISSA","Do you have to?"
"01","05","99","RYAN","Uh. (looks torn for a moment) One second."
"01","05","100","RYAN","(sighs) Hello?"
"01","05","101","SETH","Hey, it's Seth. Your friend Donnie's kind of a psycho."
"01","05","101","RYAN","Uh. Okay. Not really a good time right now."
"01","05","101","SETH","Yeah, dude, trust me, I wouldn't be calling up if it wasn't serious. (Donnie and his friends are fooling around in the kitchen) Just take my dad's car and meet me at Holly's."
"01","05","101","RYAN","(considers this for a moment while looking at Marissa) I'll be right there. (hangs up and turns back to Marissa) Okay. So, that was Seth. Uh, I got to go pick him up. He's at Holly's if you want -"
"01","05","101","MARISSA","(shaking her head) I can't go there."
"01","05","101","RYAN","Right. Okay. So, uh... (walking back to her) Sorry, I..."
"01","05","101","MARISSA","(shaking her head) No. It's okay."
"01","05","102","LUKE","You have any idea how long I've wanted to do this?"
"01","05","103","SETH","No, no, no, no. (watches as Donnie attempts to make a drink)"
"01","05","105","LUKE","You go. (rubs his eyes with his fingers) I'll, uh, I'm right behind you. (thumps the bed in frustration, but follows her)"
"01","05","106","LUKE","Jackass. What's your problem?"
"01","05","107","SETH","Uh, er, Luke. You really don't want to -"
"01","05","107","LUKE","(pushing Seth away angrily) Shut up, Cohen! How did you get in here anyway? (standing directly in front of Donnie) Look, I don't know who you are, but you best be leaving."
"01","05","107","RYAN","(rushing in) Donnie! What's up?"
"01","05","107","LUKE","Should have figured this chump was a friend of yours. Why don't you just take him back to the trailer park?"
"01","05","107","SETH","(grabbing Ryan) We should go."
"01","05","107","LUKE","All right. (shoves Donnie hard) Let's go!"
"01","05","107","RYAN","(steps in to stop Luke) Hey, hey!"
"01","05","107","SETH","(putting an arm out to 'protect' Summer) Yeah, he's definitely flawed."
"01","05","107","LUKE","I'm - I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
"01","05","107","RYAN","You scared him. Put it down, all right?"
"01","05","109","SUMMER","Oh my God!"
"01","05","110","SUMMER","(rushes over to Luke) Oh my God. (to everyone else) Call an ambulance!"

"01","05","112","KIRSTEN","I'm sorry if I upset you. It wasn't my place."
"01","05","113","JULIE","(looking straight ahead) I remember as a kid if I saw a limousine driving, I always tried to see through the tinted window, wondering what kind of life the people inside lived. How glamorous looking. Who knew, right? (pauses) You knew. You were probably in there staring back at me. Which means I've been jealous of you since I was eight. When I met Jimmy, I had nothing, no money. I don't want to go back to being nothing again."
"01","05","113","KIRSTEN","You won't. You have a family. You have Jimmy. He loves you."
"01","05","113","JULIE","(turning to Kirsten) Not as much as he loved you. (Kirsten doesn't know what to say) But I knew that when I married him. I was winning the lottery. Great guy, great life. And he was doing the honourable thing."
"01","05","113","KIRSTEN","It's your turn Julie. Don't abandon him."
"01","05","114","RYAN","Hey. It's me. Yeah, no, uhm. I'm sorry. I'm - I'm at the hospital. No, everything - everything's fine. But, uhm, I think you're going to want to get down here."

"01","07","3","RYAN","What happens in Mexico?"
"01","07","3","SETH","I don't know, because it stays there, that's why we must go."
"01","07","3","RYAN","ahh.. I don't know about lying to your parents."
"01","07","3","SETH","Okay, i can respect that. I will lie to them."

"01","07","5","RYAN","Well, won't you be hanging out with Summer?"
"01","07","5","SETH","No, because she'll probably be shacked up with Luke."

"01","07","11","RYAN","But I mean, you'll still be a public defender, right?"
"01","07","11","KIRSTEN","After 15 years? There's no way he's selling out."
"01","07","11","SANDY","Well, it'd have to be one hell of a free meal."
"01","07","11","SETH","And that's what they call a call-back in comedy, Ryan."

"01","08","8","JULIE","Excuse me, Ryan can I talk to you for a sec"
"01","08","9","JULIE","I don't know what happened in Mexico, but here's what I do know. Since you showed up Marissa's ben a wreck, comes home crying, doesn't want to go to her own catillion, having problems with her boyfriend(pause) and now you can add another shining accomplishment to your list of achievements. In addition to stealing cars, burning down houses and befriending wood be assassins (pause) You've almost killed my daughter"
"01","08","10","RYAN","You can blame me all you want (pause) but I would never do anything to hurt Marissa"
"01","08","11","JULIE","well you're not going to get the chance because you're never going to see her again, you even try and I'll make sure you're thrown back in juvi where you belong"
"01","08","12","SETH","well, so wait, I don't get it Luke's the one that she should be blaming not you"
"01","08","12","RYAN","She doesn't know that"

"01","08","14","RYAN","(sigh) its just, it's you know at hales (I assume old school) you sorta showed up, no essays, interviews, tests (sigh)"
"01","08","14","KIRSTEN","Ryan the Harbor school is one of the best private prep schools in the country; if you graduate from here you can get into any college in the UC system, maybe even an Ivy League"
"01","08","14","RYAN","I don't really think I'm an Ivy League kinda guy"
"01","08","14","KIRSTEN","After a year or two here you will be"
"01","08","14","RYAN","college huh"

"01","08","14","SETH","Uhh AP history English calculus and physics and French four, good thing I don't have a life (to Ryan) what is wrong? Are you nervous?"
"01","08","14","KIRSTEN","Seth would you please tell Ryan that Dr Kim is very nice"
"01","08","14","SETH","Oh yeah, she is sweet!"
"01","08","15","KIRSTEN","Hi (shakes her hand) nice to see you"
"01","08","15","SANDY","Well, this doesn't suck!"
"01","08","15","SANDY","Like you guys ever actually go to trial"
"01","08","15","SANDY","My wife LOVES being married to a corporate sell out, right-right-right- right, wrappin my head around it"
"01","08","16","SANDY","You gotta be kidding me"
"01","08","17","SANDY","Chemical peel gone awry, fascinating, bad botox injection, noise complaint on a yacht"
"01","08","17","SANDY","In the pure sense of the word"
"01","08","17","SANDY","Just defend them, right. rich people need lawyers to!"
"01","08","17","KIRSTEN","It was a misdemeanor, probation"
"01","08","17","KIRSTEN","Dr Kim Ryan's had alot to overcome, but Sandy and I feel that in the right environment he could really excel"
"01","08","17","KIRSTEN","Or are you concerned about the pressure from parents who don't want Ryan here"
"01","08","18","RYAN","My background? (Dr Kim looks suprised) (sighs) I can't change where I'm from but I can change where I'm going"
"01","08","19","RYAN","With all due respect Dr Kim, if you think not letting me in is gonna inspire self confidence (sincerely) Give me a shot"
"01","08","19","RYAN","Just tell me where and when!"

"01","08","21","SUMMER","It is so weird being in school right now, surrounded by all these people who have like...no idea"
"01","08","21","SETH","I know...have you talked to Marissa?"
"01","08","21","SUMMER","I spoke to her mom... you?"
"01","08","21","SETH","Ah, We went by this morning but she was sleeping (pause) I think she's gonna be ok though"
"01","08","21","SUMMER","I still can't believe it, you know... I thought she was dead"
"01","08","21","SETH","Me too...well hey maybe when she's feeling better we'll um, we'll take her out and try and cheer her up. Take her to a movie or, six flags that kinda thing"
"01","08","21","SUMMER","Yeah, I guess..."
"01","08","21","SETH","Maybe before then if you want ah, I don't know you and me could go see a movie...or something"
"01","08","22","SUMMER","Hey, guys"
"01","08","23","SUMMER","Look, Cohen, this years all messed up, I mean Marissa's in the hospital, I'll never speak to Luke or Holly again...you and I w"

"01","08","25","JIMMY","Strong sedative huh"
"01","08","25","JULIE","Yeah, she needs to sleep (takes a sip of coffee) and we need to talk (gets up and moves close to the door) Look um Jimmy, you and I we need to present a united front. It's hard enough this forcing us to be in the same room together"
"01","08","25","JIMMY","Thanks Jules, you got a great, great bed side manner"
"01","08","25","JULIE","Calling the Cohen's this morning was completely inappropriate. You know I don't like that Brian"
"01","08","26","JIMMY","(off screen) Ryan"
"01","08","26","JULIE","(off screen) I don't want him anywhere near Marissa"
"01","08","27","JIMMY","(whispering) Marissa said it was an accident, ok there's-there's no one to blame"
"01","08","28","JULIE","well that's a convenient position to take considering you're the one who let her go to Tijuana in the first place"
"01","08","28","JIMMY","Oh, so uh now it's my fault?"
"01","08","28","JULIE","You're the one who destroyed this family Jimmy, you lied to us, you stole money from your clients and your friends. Why do you think she took all those pills?"
"01","08","28","JIMMY","(scoffs, whispers) You cannot honestly believe that"
"01","08","28","JULIE","I left her in your care for one weekend and look what happened...which is why I'm asking the judge for sole custody"
"01","08","29","JIMMY","Julie, come on, you can't"
"01","08","29","JULIE","Getting the girls away from you is my only chance to give them back some semblance of a life, and if you fight me on this I'll take you to court and you'll be lucky if you even get supervised visitation"
"01","08","29","JIMMY","Yeah well you're gonna have to because (whispers) I am not giving up my kids"
"01","08","29","JULIE","You may not have a choice (off screen - a close up of Marissa with her eyes closed, and a tear rolling down her face) I'm going back to check on Caitlyn and the sitter. You should get cleaned up, you're a wreck"
"01","08","30","SETH","It's a good thing I never thrown anything away, the questions are different but you get the idea"

"01","08","35","JULIE","(off screen) Excuse me nurse, when you get a chance lunch please"
"01","08","35","MARISSA","(to Ryan) you should... (motions to hide)"
"01","08","36","JULIE","Ooh, sweetie you're awake, aw, how are you feeling? your sister sends her love"
"01","08","36","MARISSA","mm (frowning) my throat hurts"
"01","08","36","JULIE","It's because they had to pump your stomach honey (sees the flowers) Where did that thing come from?"
"01","08","36","MARISSA","oh I, I don't know"
"01","08","36","JULIE","It's from him (shot of Ryan) he came here didn't he after I told him not to, after everything he's done to y"

"01","08","37","MARISSA","I'm sorry about that y, you know about her"
"01","08","37","RYAN","that's ok, I should go and take this test but I'll be back first chance I get"
"01","08","37","MARISSA","I don't know...with my mom I"
"01","08","37","RYAN","I'm not afraid of your mom"
"01","08","37","MARISSA","Well, I am"
"01","08","38","KIRSTEN","Did you ask, Ryan what he wants for lunch"
"01","08","38","SETH","He doesn't want any, he's on a diet"
"01","08","38","KIRSTEN","why is he on a diet?"
"01","08","38","SETH","WHY is he on a diet?"
"01","08","38","KIRSTEN","Well I'm gonna ask him because I wanna see how he's doing on his"
"01","08","38","SETH","mom-mom-mom-mom-mom (grabs her as she walks past) uh he's in a state of deep-deep-deep zen like concentration right now, ok"

"01","08","40","KIRSTEN","Why would she do that?"
"01","08","40","JIMMY","Well my question is can she, I just need to know what kind of shot I have at joint custody given what I've put my family through...I just wanna know what kind of case she has"

"01","09","13","KIRSTEN","Rachel's attractive?"
"01","09","13","SANDY","is that her name? its context only you know in relation to which she invokes amorous feelings in my far more, extremely more attractive wife"
"01","09","13","KIRSTEN","good answer (she kisses him again, they sit back up) mornings use to be our time"
"01","09","13","SANDY","(with his head buried in her neck) oh I remember them well"

"01","09","15","SUMMER","there's nothing but empty chairs at your table"
"01","09","15","SETH","(gasps)"
"01","09","16","ANNA","Seth Cohen!"
"01","09","16","SETH","Anna! (gives her a hug) hey how're you doin"
"01","09","16","SUMMER","(looks jealous) um excuse me we were talking here"
"01","09","16","ANNA","oh, so insulting him counts as conversation"
"01","09","16","SETH","yeah well if it doesn't then we've never spoken, Summer you remember Anna right, she's moved here from Pittsburgh"
"01","09","16","SUMMER","how could I forget (walks away)"
"01","09","16","SETH","oh hey so we're gonna, we're gonna still be on for lunch today right... (to Anna) she probably didn't even hear me"
"01","09","16","ANNA","Seth, what are you doing? I thought you got passed this whole Summer thing at Catillion"
"01","09","16","SETH","Right, and I know Anna that it seems like not alot of progress has been made but I have to tell you, well yeah not that much progress has been made despite all my best judgements I cannot, not like her"
"01","09","16","ANNA","you are such a boy!"
"01","09","16","SETH","well, whatever. I don't see what the problem is I'm nothing but available to that girl"
"01","09","16","ANNA","alright, right there, that's your problem. girls like to be chased by guys that aren't into them"
"01","09","16","SETH","and that sounds a little bit like a game to me Anna and I don't really like to play games ok, unless we're talking about a little-a little Saturday night jenga, a little-little magic gathering. LOVE magic gather"
"01","09","16","ANNA","maybe you just don't know how to play"
"01","09","16","SETH","well, your a gir...l right"
"01","09","16","ANNA","yeah"

"01","09","16","ANNA","I don't understand the mind of chicks like Summer"
"01","09","16","SETH","ill teach ya how to play jenga"
"01","09","16","ANNA","(sighs) do you really like her"
"01","09","16","SETH","(nods) since I was ten"
"01","09","16","ANNA","(giving in) fine...but I make no promises"
"01","09","16","SETH","trust me I cannot do any worse then I've been doing"
"01","09","16","ANNA","that I trust"
"01","09","16","SETH","You're my girl!"
"01","09","16","SANDY","hey"

"01","09","16","SANDY","yeah, it's the largest coastal wetlands in California, home to the blue heron and the brown pelican and my personal favourite something called the swamp rose"
"01","09","16","SANDY","so naturally they must be destroyed"
"01","09","16","SANDY","yeah, every developers been going after the heights for years"
"01","09","16","SANDY","(sarcastically) oh thank god cause you know the lack of golf courses around here is, it's tragic"
"01","09","16","SANDY","and you wanna share this with me"
"01","09","16","SANDY","why?"
"01","09","17","SANDY","oh, my wife's company is the plaintiff"
"01","09","17","SANDY","so why even tempt me with this, it's a conflict of interest I, I'm not even sure it'd be ethical"
"01","09","17","SANDY","I suspect my wife is gonna have a different spin on all this"
"01","09","18","MARISSA","I know Dr Kim but that was before everything that's happened this summer"
"01","09","18","MARISSA","not anymore they don't"
"01","09","18","SETH","Hey what're you doing?"
"01","09","18","RYAN","you haven't told me about summer reading?"
"01","09","18","SETH","who does summer reading"
"01","09","18","RYAN","apparently everyone in my class"
"01","09","18","SETH","oh, yeah sorry about that one. so listen Anna here has convinced me to join the plank, it's the literary magazine"
"01","09","18","ANNA","I needed an extra curricular activity and apparently you don't have to wear a sports bra to be on the lit mag"
"01","09","18","SETH","See it's appealing on many levels, plus I feel I uh have a few limericks that are ready to be shared with the world"
"01","09","18","RYAN","well have fun, I'm gonna hang with Marissa"

"01","09","22","SANDY","we're talking about destroying one of the most biologically productive ecosystems in the world, its like selling off the rainforest to profit a few wealthy individuals and asking generations and generations of others to pay for it"
"01","09","22","KIRSTEN","we have proposed to protect three hundred and fifty acres of wildlife refuge and a natural park"
"01","09","22","SANDY","you'll still add thirty percent more traffic and ten tonnes of air pollution daily, not to mention what you'll do to the water supply"
"01","09","22","KIRSTEN","your gonna take this, I"
"01","09","22","SANDY","n, no"

"01","09","38","SANDY","SIT down and listen to me (Ryan doesn't move) You can stand if you want but you know how lawyers love to talk (Ryan sits on the bed) The last thing you need is for this blow out on the soccer field to turn into a suspension from school. This school could do great things for you"
"01","09","38","RYAN","for Seth maybe, not for me"
"01","09","38","SANDY","you're angry, I know that, I don't blame ya, every day at that school your gonna run into spoilt little rich kids who's ass you are gonna wanna kick, well you've just gotta find a way to work it out right now because forget about suspension...we're always one mistake away from...from someone taking you from us"
"01","09","39","SETH","huh, and women usually find stuck brutality so romantic"
"01","09","39","RYAN","I messed up"
"01","09","39","SETH","ah yeah, well its my experience in life Ryan that you should always apologise alright, even if you haven't done anything wrong, your shoes would get peed in so much less...it was a metaphor"
"01","09","39","RYAN","apologise, right, and to Luke"

"01","10","9","ANNA","I don't understand why you just don't take her to dinner an a movie, it's a classic combination"
"01","10","9","RYAN","because somebody promised her the best date ever"
"01","10","9","SETH","Ryan, I went ahead an I did a little recon on your behalf I was extremely stealth and I spoke to Summer, okay, an I asked her what would Marissa wanna do on a date, what would she really enjoy and she told me...she didn't know"
"01","10","9","ANNA","(sarcastic) how helpful!"
"01","10","9","SETH","BUT Summers three favourite activities are shopping tanning and waxing, maybe there's something there man, they're best friends, use that"
"01","10","9","ANNA","and here I thought Summer was superficial"
"01","10","9","RYAN","I have no car no money, whatever I do it's just gonna disappoint her"
"01","10","9","ANNA","what'd you usually do on dates?"
"01","10","9","RYAN","I've never actually been on one"

"01","10","10","SETH","no we don't, we don't we talk about all sorts of things all the time, we talk about music, we talk about sailing, what"
"01","10","10","ANNA","Right about how you named your boat after her how you made her a burned CD with all your favourite songs with the word summer in it"

"01","10","10","MARISSA","how are we doing, mom"
"01","10","10","JIMMY","Marissa why don't you come over here and -and talk to us okay, come on over and sit down"
"01","10","11","JULIE","I'm throwing a party. I'm hosting the children's hospital benefit this Saturday, they're trying to build a new wing for the children...and I would love it if you could both be there. your fathers already agreed"
"01","10","11","MARISSA","No, no way"
"01","10","11","JULIE","Marissa, honey. this party is a chance for us to show the community that we still belong, that we're still a family. yes we've suffered some set backs your fathers business in particular, but its important for us to let everybody know the Cooper family is back"
"01","10","11","MARISSA","why do you care what other people think?"
"01","10","11","JIMMY","look Marissa no one has fewer nice things to say about your mother then me, (to Julie) no offence, but she's been pouring her heart out to me and I think you're gonna wanna hear what she has to say"
"01","10","11","JULIE","Marissa, I am so sorry... for the way I handled things at the hospital (sincerely) I was scared... and I was wrong, everything I cared about was falling apart and I was blaming everybody but myself...I just want us to feel like a family again. now I know it's gonna take some time and I'm gonna need your help, will you help me (holds hand out to Marissa, Marissa takes it)"
"01","10","11","RYAN","wow knocking, IT'S OPEN"
"01","10","12","RYAN","oh, that sucks (looking relieved, lol)"

"01","10","12","RYAN","your mom-your mom hates me"
"01","10","12","MARISSA","no. no she doesn't hate you she just doesn't know you, but now she'll have her chance"
"01","10","12","RYAN","bu, we had a date Saturday night, I mean there was a whole thing happening"
"01","10","12","MARISSA","I know but my mom came by today and apologised to me and my dad and it seems like she's changed...hey if my parents got back together and my dad found a new job, then my life could go back to normal again"
"01","10","12","RYAN","well maybe I should stay away for a little while give you guys"
"01","10","12","MARISSA","look first date stuff, candy flowers that's easy"
"01","10","12","RYAN","candy, flowers right"
"01","10","13","MARISSA","(smiling) but its times like these when a girl needs her boyfriend the most"
"01","10","13","RYAN","(stunned) boyfriend"
"01","10","13","MARISSA","well, I mean, aren't we"
"01","10","13","RYAN","(smiling) I-I-I guess, I've just never been a boyfriend before"

"01","10","14","SETH","hey. so get this uh Anna thinks all I ever do is talk about Summer...I mean that's crazy right"
"01","10","14","RYAN","you want me to lie"
"01","10","14","SETH","I'm that guy. (Ryan looks at him) dude how can I be that guy, I hate that guy. well then no wonder Summer doesn't have any interest in me cause apparently all I do is I talk about Summer, although you'd think she'd like that"
"01","10","14","RYAN","(swallows juice) you're doing it again"
"01","10","14","SETH","right"
"01","10","14","SANDY","I'm sorry I had to cancel our date last night"

"01","11","4","SANDY","well I bet he'll have less indigestion this year, unlike your father who will probably be in agony"
"01","11","4","KIRSTEN","(laughs) I can't believe he is having thanksgiving with Julie Cooper (slightly hurt) cause he's never had it with us"
"01","11","4","SANDY","uh no complaint here"

"01","11","39","SUMMER","what (laughs)"

"01","11","39","SUMMER","whoa, what-what'd you mean this is happening n-n-n-no Cohen (pushes him off her) no"
"01","11","39","SETH","(falls on the floor) ahh ooow"
"01","11","39","SUMMER","no you know what th-this cant be happening"
"01","11","39","SETH","yes it can come on it just was I was just expressing awe and delight which now will be replaced with a severe bruise on my ass"
"01","11","39","SUMMER","ok I need to think, or eat something I'm feeling a little headed, can we go inside"
"01","11","39","SETH","no actually um I think that its best then (doing up his shirt) if I go inside because I'm the host an I-I bring food to you cause your the guest an I think that's really the most polite thing to do, also you probably don't wanna go in there right now cause my moms cooking and that's something that-that nobody should witness and plus my dad is wearing an apron so that also falls into the same category and my grandpas talkin about politics in there and (getting faster, puts on his vest) nobody likes politics not when he talks about it he's very intense and you don't wanna get all tensed out right now so stay here where the relaxation is, I'll be right back (leaves)"
"01","11","40","JULIE","this is your fault because you allowed her to go with Ryan"

"01","11","40","JULIE","(to Rachel) you stay out of this I don't even know what you're doing here"
"01","11","40","KIRSTEN","(drunk) oh she's our guest, unlike some people"
"01","11","40","JULIE","oh so suddenly you have standards about who you let into this house"
"01","11","40","KIRSTEN","what'does that mean"
"01","11","40","JULIE","Marissa wouldn't be in Chino if she hadn't met someone from Chino"
"01","11","40","SANDY","Ryan's not the problem"
"01","11","40","CALEB","your right it's the over zealous tree hugger that brought him in"
"01","11","40","JULIE","or the irresponsible parent whose to busy tryin'a get laid on thanksgiving"
"01","11","40","JIMMY","well excuse me for making up for lost time"

"01","11","41","SETH","it's gettin a little weird in here"
"01","11","41","ANNA","(sitting up) well you left me alone for so long I guess I was going a little...crazy"

"01","12","27","KIRSTEN","he told you"
"01","12","27","SANDY","well he didn't want there to be any secrets between us, apparently you don't feel the same way"
"01","12","27","KIRSTEN","of course I do, it's just that it meant - nothing"
"01","12","27","SANDY","well putting my own skepticism about that remark aside for a just a moment if it meant nothing...then why didn't you tell me"
"01","12","27","KIRSTEN","...because I knew it would upset you"
"01","12","27","SANDY","thankyou... (hurt) cause I feel so much better having heard it from someone else"
"01","12","27","KIRSTEN","(softly & sincerely) I'm sorry"
"01","12","27","SANDY","well all this time all this suspicion and paranoia about me an my co-worker an-an- an your sittin on this (walks away)"
"01","12","27","KIRSTEN","(sighs) Sandy Sandy (follows) (turns him around to face her) it means nothing"
"01","12","27","SANDY","(hurt) well it means somethin a me (leaves)"
"01","12","28","SETH","ok its just that (begins to laugh) after all the years of Luke callin me gay, I don't know I think its great that now the shoe is on the other actually its on his dads foot but you get the symmetry I'm goin for"
"01","12","28","SANDY","it's not funny... it's the end of their marriage, their life as they knew it is over"
"01","12","28","KIRSTEN","I heard Meredith's already filing for divorce"
"01","12","28","RYAN","I was just over there they seemed really happy"
"01","12","28","SETH","yeah, by happy do you mean (whispers) gay"
"01","12","28","KIRSTEN","Seth"
"01","12","28","SETH","yes?"
"01","12","28","KIRSTEN","cut it out!"
"01","12","28","RYAN","I mean how can you be married to somebody for that long an keep that kind of a secret"
"01","12","28","SANDY","oh you'd be suprised (looks straight at Kirsten) but eventually the secrets come out"
"01","12","28","KIRSTEN","and some marriages can handle the truth an some cant (looks straight at Sandy)"
"01","12","29","SETH","yeah well I'm sure everyone 'll be so accepting seein as we're such a-a liberal, tolerant bunch (to Sandy) and that was at the expense of Orange County not Luke's dad, his big gay dad"
"01","12","31","KIRSTEN","I can't be here right now"
"01","12","31","JULIE","have you eaten?"
"01","12","31","KIRSTEN","what'd you have in mind?"

"01","12","33","JULIE","mm (swallows her beer) well I can't exactly claim that I didn't once see the fun in witnessing the fall of the rich and fabulous... and then I became homeless an suddenly not so funny"
"01","12","33","KIRSTEN","I don't really think that my dad would let you go homeless"
"01","12","33","JULIE","yeah well uh when I even mention that I might have to sell the house he went into a panic, you'd of thought I was asking for a ring"
"01","12","33","KIRSTEN","(laughs) that's so him"
"01","12","33","JULIE","an then when I tried to explain-"

"01","12","33","JULIE","cause he kept calling me Juju, like that candy that gets stuck in your teeth, I begged him to stop-"
"01","12","33","KIRSTEN","but when he gets something in his head (smiles)"
"01","12","33","JULIE","it has to be his way"
"01","12","33","KIRSTEN","always"
"01","12","34","KIRSTEN","its just who he is, he jus cant spend longer then three months with the same woman before he freaks"
"01","12","34","JULIE","oh he freaked alright"
"01","12","34","KIRSTEN","an I jus wish that I could tell him that I know what he's doing, he's trying to replace my mom...but he cant...an I just wish that he would... stop trying an be happy, but you cant talk to my dad"
"01","12","34","JULIE","(smiles) no I know"
"01","12","34","KIRSTEN","and the important thing is is that he finds someone to share his life with, enjoy these years...I jus don't know if he's ever gonna figure that out"

"01","12","41","LUKE","everything's jus so screwed up"
"01","12","41","LUKE","is there a problem...other then the fact that we kick your ass every year"

"01","12","49","RYAN","I never shoulda told you"
"01","12","49","MARISSA","because I'll tell everyone right"
"01","12","49","RYAN","no, because he asked me not to"
"01","12","49","MARISSA","but see the unwritten rule of relationships is you're allowed to tell your girlfriend, because everything you say to me stays with me and vice versa"
"01","12","49","RYAN","so then you didn't tell anybody that I went off on you yesterday when I thought you told"
"01","12","49","MARISSA","no...well I mean jus Summer"

"01","12","50","SANDY","hey if theres anything we could do"
"01","12","50","SANDY","(follows) noo I think that'd be the worst thing you could do, I mean it's what you ben doin all along y'know but comin out an bein honest with yourself an your family, in this town, it's the bravest thing you coulda done. look its jus my opinion but... you're the kinda father any kid'd be proud of"
"01","12","50","LUKE","(standing around the corner) dad (they stare at each other) jus let me grab my shoes...I'll go with you"
"01","12","51","KIRSTEN","so, while we're being honest"

"01","12","51","SANDY","well you know I'm prone to impressive speeches"
"01","12","51","KIRSTEN","right up until that line, yeah (Sandy laughs)"
"01","12","51","SANDY","so from now on are you gonna tell me all your secrets"
"01","12","51","KIRSTEN","are you gonna tell me all yours?"

"01","12","51","SANDY","yeah"
"01","12","51","KIRSTEN","you sure?"
"01","12","51","SANDY","I think"
"01","12","51","KIRSTEN","nothing from your past, no secret fantasies, no hidden p0rn stash (laughs) on the PC"
"01","12","51","SANDY","no cause obviously you already know about that one"
"01","12","51","KIRSTEN","(walks over to him) (softly) there's no way you can know everything about someone, that's what keeps it interesting"
"01","12","51","SANDY","well it hasn't ben uninteresting"
"01","12","51","KIRSTEN","at a certain point you have to trust the other person, that's what love is"
"01","12","51","SANDY","ok... so you'll have to trust that you can tell me things that I may not wanna hear we-we can handle it"
"01","12","51","KIRSTEN","like...Jimmy Cooper kissed me"
"01","12","51","SANDY","(touches her face) trust me (they kiss)"
"01","12","51","LUKE","this is gonna be weird"
"01","12","51","RYAN","yep"
"01","12","51","LUKE","everybody's gonna be starin at me, talkin"
"01","12","51","MARISSA","yep"
"01","12","51","LUKE","maybe I can just blow the whole thing off, go hit the beach, give everybody time to get it outta their systems"
"01","12","51","RYAN","oh it doesn't work like that, its ben months I'm still the kid from China that burned a house down"
"01","12","51","MARISSA","and I'm still the girl who tried to kill herself in Mexico"
"01","12","51","SETH","I'm still...I'm still Seth Cohen"
"01","12","51","LUKE","man this is gonna suck"
"01","12","51","SETH","yep well, welcome to my world"
"01","13","0","SETH","So, what's it going to be, huh? You want your menorah or a"
"01","13","1","RYAN","Um… I'm not-"
"01","13","1","SETH","Ah! Don't worry about it buddy, because in this house, you"
"01","13","2","RYAN","Chrismukkah?"
"01","13","2","SETH","That's right. It's the new holiday, Ryan, and it's sweeping"
"01","13","3","SANDY","Hey fellows. We go the tree."
"01","13","3","SETH","Or atleast the living room."
"01","13","3","SANDY","Guys, a little help?"
"01","13","4","SETH","I saved a spot for you right there. Put your muscle into it."
"01","13","5","KIRSTEN","We didn't really know how to raise Seth."
"01","13","5","SETH","Yeah, so I raised myself, and in doing so, I created the"
"01","13","6","RYAN","And you call it Chrismukkah."
"01","13","6","SETH","(He gasps) Just hearing you say it makes me feel all festive."
"01","13","7","SETH","You see, for my father here, a poor struggling Jew growing up"
"01","13","8","SETH","And for my mom over here – WASPy McWASP – well, it meant a"
"01","13","9","SANDY","We're very proud."
"01","13","9","KIRSTEN","I'm not a WASP."
"01","13","9","SETH","Sure, you're not. Other highlights include eight days of"
"01","13","10","RYAN","Uh, sounds great for you guys."
"01","13","10","SANDY","For you, too."
"01","13","10","SETH","Hey, dip a toe in the Chrismukkah pool. There's room for all"
"01","13","11","KIRSTEN","Isn't there something in the Atwood family tradition that"
"01","13","12","RYAN","Atwood and holidays is not a good combination."
"01","13","12","SANDY","What did you guys do?"
"01","13","12","RYAN","No, seriously, thanks, but uh…"
"01","13","12","SETH","Come on, man. There's got to be something."
"01","13","12","RYAN","My holiday memories pretty much consist of my mom drunk and me"
"01","13","13","SANDY","Well, this year will be entirely different."
"01","13","13","KIRSTEN","New memories. It'll be great."
"01","13","13","RYAN","Yeah. Well, whatever you want me to do, I'll do."
"01","13","13","SETH","That's the spirit. Come here."
"01","13","14","SETH","Oy, humbug."
"01","13","14","KIRSTEN","It's a big holiday for anyone."
"01","13","14","SANDY","Yeah, I'm still wrapping my head around it. Just give him"
"01","13","15","KIRSTEN","Why don't we trim the tree?"
"01","13","15","SETH","You know what, you guys? Soon, Ryan will learn the magic of"
"01","13","16","RYAN","I was in the shower for five minutes. How did this place turn"
"01","13","17","SETH","I see someone took down the wreath I hung on the door."
"01","13","17","RYAN","It fell. What are you wrapping?"
"01","13","17","SETH","Two Seth Cohen starter packs. We got Death cab, we got Bright"
"01","13","18","RYAN","You're getting Summer and Anna the same thing?"
"01","13","18","SETH","Yes, I am. Sometimes I'm so crafty, I surprise myself."
"01","13","18","RYAN","No good can come of this. You know that, right?"
"01","13","18","SETH","Uh, nope, I don't."
"01","13","18","RYAN","You're going to have to choose, man."
"01","13","18","SETH","Hey, not on Chrismukkah I don't, okay? There's no choosing in"
"01","13","19","RYAN","Well, you didn't get me anything, right?"
"01","13","19","SETH","No."
"01","13","20","SETH","Come on, man. Lighten up."
"01","13","21","SETH","Okay, fine. Stay dark. Dark works, too."
"01","13","22","KIRSTEN","Oh, Ryan, what is your show size?"
"01","13","22","RYAN","Why?"
"01","13","22","KIRSTEN","No reason."
"01","13","22","SETH","Mother, might that be a Chrismukkah list?"
"01","13","22","KIRSTEN","No. Why do you ask?"
"01","13","22","SETH","Okay. Let me just see it then, real fast."
"01","13","22","KIRSTEN","It's work."
"01","13","22","SETH","Okay, I love your work. It fascinates me."
"01","13","22","RYAN","I thought you guys said no gifts."
"01","13","22","KIRSTEN","Well, we did, as in no gifts for us."
"01","13","23","SANDY","Well, Chrismukkah's ruined."
"01","13","23","SETH","Ah! Don't even say it, man. Come on. Chrismukkah is"
"01","13","24","SANDY","Your father just refused out latest settlement offer. He"
"01","13","25","KIRSTEN","That's not what he said yesterday. He said that if you met"
"01","13","26","SANDY","Yeah, well as of this morning, Ebenezer Scrooge decides he"
"01","13","27","KIRSTEN","Chrismukkah is ruined. Sooner or later, we will get through"
"01","13","28","SETH","Stop it, right now, okay? Don't give up on the miracle that is"
"01","13","29","RYAN","You're really starting to scare me."
"01","13","29","SETH","I'm okay with that."
"01","13","30","JIMMY","Okey dokey, here we go. Which tie? What are you thinking?"
"01","13","31","MARISSA","Uh, the second one, definitely."
"01","13","31","JIMMY","All right."
"01","13","32","MARISSA","So, you have a job interview today?"
"01","13","32","JIMMY","Well, it's just a meet-and-greet. Who knows what will come of"
"01","13","33","MARISSA","There doesn't have to be any extra pressure because there"
"01","13","34","JIMMY","What are you talking about?"
"01","13","34","MARISSA","We can skip Christmas. I mean, it's not like it's not going"
"01","13","35","JIMMY","Are you? Depressed? I mean you were supposed to go to therapy"
"01","13","36","MARISSA","I'm great. I'm just saying."
"01","13","36","JIMMY","Ok, good, because we're not skipping Christmas. Come on. I'm"
"01","13","37","MARISSA","Yeah, definitely. You look great."
"01","13","38","JIMMY","Skipping Christmas – what are you, the Grinch?"
"01","13","39","RYAN","So, Summer and Anna are both coming to this party."
"01","13","39","SETH","Yeah, but neither one's my date."
"01","13","39","RYAN","And they know?"
"01","13","39","SETH","Oh yeah. They both know that. Come on, man, relax. Look, it's"
"01","13","40","RYAN","And when Chrismukkah ends?"
"01","13","40","SETH","(He gasps) I hate when Chrismukkah ends."
"01","13","40","SUMMER","Cohen. Hi, Ryan. Um, I wanted to know what the deal was for"
"01","13","41","ANNA","Hey, Seth. So, what time are you thinking for tonight? (She"
"01","13","42","SUMMER","Hey, Anna."
"01","13","42","SETH","You guys. I was thinking we should all probably meet there."
"01","13","43","SUMMER","Sounds great."
"01","13","43","ANNA","Yeah, perfect."
"01","13","44","RYAN","You better pray for a Chrismukkah miracle."
"01","13","45","SETH","I've got Jesus and Moses on my side, man."
"01","13","46","JULIE","Hey, Kirsten. What do you think?"
"01","13","46","KIRSTEN","It's really something."
"01","13","46","JULIE","You don't like it?"
"01","13","46","KIRSTEN","It's not that. It's just that… my mom used to put the"
"01","13","47","JULIE","Yeah, Caleb told me. But then I thought you know what? The"
"01","13","48","KIRSTEN","He did? He's just full of surprises."
"01","13","49","CALEB","I changed my mind. If the land trust can come up with $200"
"01","13","50","KIRSTEN","I just… I thought this was over."
"01","13","50","CALEB","You can always get a little more blood out of the stone."
"01","13","50","KIRSTEN","But the stone is my husband."
"01","13","50","CALEB","Well, I was thinking we could spend the holidays working."
"01","13","50","KIRSTEN","That sounds good. You have fun."
"01","13","50","CALEB","What are you talking about?"
"01","13","50","KIRSTEN","I'm going to do something that I haven't done in… ever. I'm"
"01","13","51","CALEB","Don't be ridiculous, Kiki. You hate sitting around the house."
"01","13","51","KIRSTEN","Well, not as much as I hate fighting with you. So you spend"
"01","13","52","MARISSA","I hate Christmas."
"01","13","52","RYAN","Yeah, well Christmukkah's not much better. You don't want to"
"01","13","53","MARISSA","I just wish my dad would drop the act. I don't need it. And"
"01","13","54","RYAN","Who do you have to spend it with?"
"01","13","54","MARISSA","Christmas Eve with my dad, Christmas day with my mom. Plus,"
"01","13","55","RYAN","The Cohen's are going too, so…"
"01","13","55","MARISSA","So, at least we'll be miserable together."
"01","13","55","RYAN","Deal?"
"01","13","55","MARISSA","Deal. So, am I seeing you after school?"
"01","13","55","RYAN","I got some stuff to do… some shopping. South Coast Plaza."
"01","13","55","MARISSA","You're going to South Coast Plaza? Alone? I don't think"
"01","13","56","RYAN","Well, you know someone?"
"01","13","57","RYAN","So no luck, huh?"
"01","13","57","MARISSA","There's a 99-cent store down the street. I guess I can't"
"01","13","58","RYAN","Then why did we come?"
"01","13","58","MARISSA","I know it sounds stupid, but I like it here. Everything is"
"01","13","59","RYAN","What are you doing?"
"01","13","60","RYAN","Why don't you just back off, all right?"
"01","13","60","MARISSA","Ryan, it's okay."
"01","13","60","RYAN","No, it's not."
"01","13","61","SETH","Hey, what are you doing? Working from home?"
"01","13","61","KIRSTEN","I'm on vacation."
"01","13","61","SETH","Ah, yes, clearly."
"01","13","61","KIRSTEN","I find reviewing end-of-the-year accounts to be very"
"01","13","62","SETH","I hope that's a recessive gene."
"01","13","62","KIRSTEN","You should be so lucky. Look, I haven't taken a vacation in"
"01","13","63","SETH","Oh, yeah. I don't judge, okay? I only mock."
"01","13","63","KIRSTEN","That you get from your father."
"01","13","63","SETH","Oh, my God. They're coming in?"
"01","13","64","SETH","Oh, that's… I got you. (He sees the presents) What are those?"
"01","13","64","KIRSTEN","They came for Ryan from his mom and his brother."
"01","13","64","SETH","You know what he said about the holidays? When he talks like"
"01","13","65","KIRSTEN","Me, neither. You just have to be yourself."
"01","13","65","SETH","Yeah, ‘cause that always works so well."
"01","13","65","KIRSTEN","Well, being a family is hard under any circumstance."
"01","13","66","SETH","Well, feeling weird is right in my…"
"01","13","67","SETH","What? What is it? Is Grandpa going crazy with the company"
"01","13","68","KIRSTEN","(Smiling) What are you talking about?"
"01","13","68","SETH","I don't know. What is it?"
"01","13","68","KIRSTEN","Hopefully, it's nothing. You should go get ready, ‘cause we"
"01","13","69","SETH","I'll go put on my face."
"01","13","70","KIRSTEN","Hi. This is Kirsten Cohen from the Newport Group. My father"
"01","13","71","JULIE","I cannot believe this. Marissa."
"01","13","71","JIMMY","Julie."
"01","13","71","JULIE","Look, I have to host the most important event of my"
"01","13","72","JIMMY","Well, atleast your priorities are in order."
"01","13","72","JULIE","You know, it's amazing how all these calamities keep"
"01","13","73","JIMMY","Oh, so I'm to blame for this one, too?"
"01","13","73","JULIE","Where do you think she learned to steal?"
"01","13","73","MARISSA","Okay, stop it. I'm the one who stole, remember? I'm the one"
"01","13","74","JIMMY","Look, we're lucky the store is not pressing charges. Okay?"
"01","13","75","JULIE","Oh, really? Well, way to rule with the iron fist, Stalin, but"
"01","13","76","MARISSA","So I can stay home tonight?"
"01","13","76","JULIE","Starting tomorrow. I won't have my party ruined by your"
"01","13","77","MARISSA","I thought it would be… Look, I wasn't… it was stupid."
"01","13","77","JULIE","Well, I called the therapist on the way over here."
"01","13","77","MARISSA","Mom."
"01","13","77","JIMMY","She's right, kiddo. Therapy was part of the deal of you"
"01","13","78","MARISSA","Okay, look, I've been doing way better since Mexico. 4.0"
"01","13","79","JULIE","I've scheduled you an appointment tomorrow morning with Dr."
"01","13","80","MARISSA","I'm sorry, but I can handle it. This. I… I won't do it"
"01","13","81","JULIE","Honey, I love you. But I don't believe you."
"01","13","81","JIMMY","You might actually find it helpful."
"01","13","81","MARISSA","Yeah. Whatever. I need to get ready."
"01","13","82","MARISSA","And Mom, you have your big party to throw. I'm sure you"
"01","13","83","SETH","Hey. What's up, man? You're back. So, that's pretty cool,"
"01","13","84","RYAN","Yeah, except now I have a total of eight gifts to buy, and I"
"01","13","85","SETH","Ryan, that sort of reminds me of the story of Hanukkah, dude."
"01","13","86","RYAN","Weird."
"01","13","86","SETH","Yes. You've really painted a picture for me. I feel like I was"
"01","13","87","RYAN","Marissa picked up a few things without paying for them."
"01","13","87","SETH","What, as in…"
"01","13","87","RYAN","Shoplifting."
"01","13","88","RYAN","Yeah."
"01","13","88","SETH","Yeah, that's weird."
"01","13","88","RYAN","It's that time of year, and with everything that's going on"
"01","13","89","SETH","Yeah, no, no. I'm sure it's got to be hard for her."
"01","13","89","RYAN","Yeah. I just wish there was something I could do or say."
"01","13","89","SETH","Um… Oh, I got you something."
"01","13","89","RYAN","No, no, no. We had an agreement."
"01","13","89","SETH","Yeah, but this is different. This is a requirement."
"01","13","90","SETH","I know, it's a bit minty, but uh… you know, we all have one,"
"01","13","91","RYAN","No. That's cool."
"01","13","91","SETH","Well, good. Maybe it'll meet a kinder fate than your wreath"
"01","13","92","RYAN","(Smiling slightly) Thanks."
"01","13","92","SETH","All right. I'm going to go make magic happen. I feel like my"
"01","13","93","SANDY","I'm late. I know, I know. I'll hurry."
"01","13","94","SANDY","So, you're not going to believe this, but your father and I"
"01","13","95","KIRSTEN","He asked you for more money?"
"01","13","95","SANDY","Oh, just $250 million. But we closed the deal, and he claims"
"01","13","96","KIRSTEN","Is that what he told you?"
"01","13","96","SANDY","And it seems your little vacation today really hit him hard."
"01","13","97","KIRSTEN","I found something today. And I don't know if I can give it"
"01","13","98","SANDY","Okay, well…"
"01","13","98","KIRSTEN","He's going to know that I gave this to you. And he's going"
"01","13","99","SANDY","You have got to be kidding me. This changes everything."
"01","13","99","KIRSTEN","And I'm going to have to learn how to relax, because I'm"
"01","13","100","SANDY","I'm sorry, honey."
"01","13","100","KIRSTEN","Not as sorry as he's going to be."
"01","13","100","SANDY","You still want to go to the party?"
"01","13","100","KIRSTEN","I wouldn't miss it for the world."
"01","13","101","SETH","Anna. Hey."
"01","13","101","ANNA","Mistletoe."
"01","13","102","SETH","Oh. Oh, that's very festive of you. Uh, I thought we were"
"01","13","103","ANNA","Well, I was thinking maybe we could go together."
"01","13","103","SETH","I would love to do that. You know I would. But don't you think"
"01","13","104","ANNA","Well, how is Summer ever going to know?"
"01","13","105","SUMMER","Mistletoe. What is she doing here?"
"01","13","105","ANNA","What are you doing here?"
"01","13","105","SUMMER","I thought we had a deal, Cohen."
"01","13","105","ANNA","Which you clearly violated."
"01","13","105","SUMMER","As did you."
"01","13","105","SETH","She's got a point."
"01","13","105","ANNA","You're on her side?"
"01","13","105","SETH","No. There are no sides, you guys. There's only um… rides with"
"01","13","106","ANNA","Fine."
"01","13","106","SUMMER","Fine."
"01","13","107","ANNA","So, I have a gift for you. I'll give it to you later."
"01","13","107","SUMMER","I have a present for you, too, also. I'll give it to you"
"01","13","108","SETH","(To Summer) I can't wait. (To Anna) For either. (To Summer)"
"01","13","109","SANDY","Seth, you ready? Come on. Let's go."
"01","13","110","KIRSTEN","Hi, Summer. Anna."
"01","13","110","SANDY","Ladies. (To Kirsten) Oh, this is going to be some party."
"01","13","110","KIRSTEN","Mm-hmm."
"01","13","111","RYAN","You know, maybe this is not such a bad idea."
"01","13","111","MARISSA","What does that mean?"
"01","13","111","RYAN","It'll be good to have someone to talk to."
"01","13","111","MARISSA","You're someone. I can't talk to you?"
"01","13","111","RYAN","You can talk to me. It's just…"
"01","13","111","MARISSA","What? I need the help of a trained professional because I"
"01","13","112","RYAN","It's not about the lipstick."
"01","13","112","MARISSA","Well, I guess I don't really see what it's about."
"01","13","112","RYAN","I guess you do what you want."
"01","13","112","MARISSA","I will. If no one's making my parents go to therapy, then"
"01","13","113","RYAN","Sure."
"01","13","114","SETH","Come on, buddy. Change it up a little bit."
"01","13","115","ANNA","Come on, Seth. I'm going this way."
"01","13","115","SETH","Oh."
"01","13","115","SUMMER","Oh, well, I'm going this way."
"01","13","116","SETH","Oh, you guys are? I'm going to go look for Ryan."
"01","13","117","JULIE","Kirsten. Sandy. Welcome."

"01","13","117","KIRSTEN","He did."
"01","13","117","SANDY","I actually need to follow up on a few things with you, Cal."
"01","13","118","CALEB","Come, Sanford. It's a party. Think back on your Berkley days."
"01","13","119","SANDY","(He chuckles) Smoke the tree. Funny. I'm going to nail him"
"01","13","120","KIRSTEN","Uh-huh."
"01","13","121","JULIE","So, what do you think?"
"01","13","121","KIRSTEN","About?"
"01","13","121","JULIE","The party. You haven't said anything. Do you like it? I mean,"
"01","13","122","KIRSTEN","It's great."
"01","13","122","JULIE","And what did Caleb think? I mean, has he said anything to you?"
"01","13","122","KIRSTEN","I haven't had a chance to talk to him."
"01","13","122","JULIE","I just want this to be a party that he'll never forget."
"01","13","122","KIRSTEN","I think you have a shot."

"01","13","124","CALEB","I haven't got time for this"
"01","13","124","SANDY","oh I think you do, allow me to summarise what you know already. the heights are size- malogically unsound, the whole area is uninsurable it's worthless"
"01","13","124","CALEB","as is your theory"
"01","13","124","SANDY","there's no way you would have gotten the building permit...and you knew that"
"01","13","124","CALEB","what'd you want Sandy"
"01","13","124","SANDY","I wanna buy back the heights...for a dollar"

"01","17","7","JULIE","coffee?"
"01","17","7","KIRSTEN","(sighs) Julie I really appreciate your desire to be such good friends, but the thing about good friends is that when they want something, they just ask"

"01","17","7","KIRSTEN","(nods) ah-huh I-I thought you wanted me to water your plants or baby-sit Caitlyn"
"01","17","7","JULIE","right because you don't take me seriously as a working woman as a designer"
"01","17","7","KIRSTEN","you're not really experienced, qualified"
"01","17","7","JULIE","before I had Marissa I was doing lots of design work"
"01","17","7","KIRSTEN","you had Marissa when you were eighteen"
"01","17","7","JULIE","(smiles) I know your usual model home designer fell out at the last minute, I know you have no one (Kirsten looks at her) Caleb pillow talk, he thought the idea was inspired"
"01","17","7","KIRSTEN","well it-it's definitely thinking outside the box"
"01","17","7","JULIE","he told me he's staying out of it though, that its up to you, look one house one shot if I screw up you can fire me yourself its a win win"

"01","17","12","RYAN","why transfer at all, a little over a semester from graduating"

"01","17","13","MARISSA","(smiles) yeah you wanna come...I was gonna help him with his French (Oliver smiles)"
"01","17","13","RYAN","French? didn't you live in Paris for a couple'a years"
"01","17","13","RYAN","oh you need Marissa to help you"
"01","17","13","RYAN","right you guys go ahead I told Seth I'd meet him back home"
"01","17","14","MARISSA","(to Ryan) you sure you don't wanna come"
"01","17","14","RYAN","yeah, I trust you"
"01","17","14","MARISSA","(kisses Ryan on the cheek) you should"
"01","17","15","SETH","I don't trust him"
"01","17","15","SANDY","trust who?"
"01","17","15","SETH","Summers new (unsure) boyfriend or whatever, somethin jus sorta seems off about him"
"01","17","15","KIRSTEN","off how?"
"01","17","15","SETH","I don't know, he's jus not funny (to Ryan) you know who I'm talkin about right, he's big (Ryan sighs) but big isn't necessarily funny, it's cheap"
"01","17","15","RYAN","(worried) he said there was an incident"
"01","17","15","SETH","big funny guy did?"
"01","17","15","RYAN","no Oliver"
"01","17","15","SETH","(rolls his eyes) ugh dude please can we forget Oliver for five seconds an talk about me"
"01","17","15","RYAN","it's the reason he left pacific w-w-what if he's violent"
"01","17","15","SETH","gee new guy shows up violent, angry prone to punching people that'd be really weird"
"01","17","15","RYAN","he needs Marissa to help him with his French, he lived in France"
"01","17","15","SETH","ok your right we should call the cops cause Oliver lost his grasp on the subjunctive"
"01","17","15","SANDY","fajitas are served"
"01","17","15","SETH","(looks) oooo"
"01","17","15","RYAN","(sits forward) nothing adds up an if I try to say anything ta Marissa"
"01","17","15","SETH","mm-mm"
"01","17","15","RYAN","maybe there's somebody I could talk to, try to figure out what happened"
"01","17","15","SETH","yeah ok or you can jus break into the file room an steal his bio ok...or you can be a grown up forget about it an move on ok like I am, to the fajitas (gets up)"
"01","17","16","RYAN","I-I forgot a book in my locker (shows the guard his school I.D)"
"01","17","18","KIRSTEN","we understand and believe me when I tell you Ryan will be punished"
"01","17","18","SANDY","of course the school must do what it deems appropriate but I beg ya to understand that this is very uncharacteristic of Ryan"
"01","17","18","RYAN","I jus...I don't trust this kid, Oliver, he seems suspicious and suddenly he's going here now"
"01","17","18","RYAN","he has a history of instability, I was concerned...for Marissa"
"01","17","18","RYAN","no but he's ben spending alotta time with her (Dr Kim just looks at him) and um there's this letter in his file"
"01","17","18","RYAN","that says they found him - in the men's bathroom at Pacific - having cut his wrists (Sandy & Kirsten look at Ryan) over a girl (to Sandy & Kirsten) she filed a restraining order that's why he left"
"01","17","18","KIRSTEN","(to Dr Kim) is this true"
"01","17","18","SANDY","and the school was receptive to him, despite his history"
"01","17","18","RYAN","I'm sorry"
"01","17","18","KIRSTEN","we are too"
"01","17","18","SANDY","(stands) well thankyou Dr Kim (shakes her hand)"

"01","20","46","RYAN","(sighs) I don't know it's complicated"
"01","20","46","SETH","(nods) that's right it is complicated, it's complicated by the fact that there's an Eddie, an this Eddie still obviously has feelings for Theresa, infact that would actually make this romantic triangle more of a romantic...rhombus"
"01","20","46","RYAN","so what am I supposed ta do?"
"01","20","46","SETH","that, I don't know, but I would do something soon otherwise (stands) someone's gonna get hurt...and judging from Eddies phone voice its probably gonna be you"

"01","21","25","SETH","I know, I get that but if it is cause'a me...maybe I can talk her out of it except for the fact that I cant ask her if its cause'a me without sounding totally self absorbed but i'm not self absorbed right Ryan me, me"

"01","21","57","CALEB","(in the background) where as my story has its own cast of characters (Marissa looks over & sees him, she looks worried) one doesn't become Riviera man of the year without some help (Eddie is now outside amongst the crowd, Marissa looks over to him, frowning) where would I be without my wonderful family (points) my beautiful daughter Kirsten, an my favourite- well my only grandson Seth, come join me"

"01","21","72","KIRSTEN","so what happens now?"
"01","21","72","SANDY","my guess is not much, since it's an election year the DA can't afford ta lose an without their start witness they don't really have a case, if your gonna go after the king, Caleb...then you had better know that you can kill the king"
"01","21","72","KIRSTEN","I told you that I didn't want you ta get involved"
"01","21","72","SANDY","I will always do what's before for my family"
"01","21","72","KIRSTEN","i'd rather go ta jail than be responsible for you being mixed up in this, getting inta bed with my father"

"01","21","79","SETH","what if the girl i'm spose'ta be with jus went back ta Pittsburgh"
"01","21","79","RYAN","what if she went back ta Chino"
"01","21","79","SETH","(playing) why would Anna go ta Chino (Ryan looks at him) i'm kidding come on"

"01","22","0","RYAN","no seriously, seriously you can stay in there turn the radio on, leave the windows up"
"01","22","0","SETH","cause I like to leave the watch on Ryan an I like to leave it on an know how i'm doing...if i'm beating my old time (Ryan turns around and groans while opening the door) the thing is its sort of a s*x marathon not a s*x sprint"
"01","22","0","RYAN","(to desk guy) excuse me, hi i'm the guy that called earlier about the watch that was left here"
"01","22","0","SETH","ok that's a little awkward"

"01","27","7","CALEB","you've come to the wrong groom, you want'to apologise do so but do it quick"
"01","27","7","SANDY","oh you have no idea how much cajoling it took to get me here, I am only here because'a Kirsten"
"01","27","7","CALEB","(scoffs) it's always cause'a Kirsten, when you rail roaded my dinner was that cause'a her too"
"01","27","7","SANDY","no, that one was for you (points)"
"01","27","7","CALEB","so, what're you gonna do when i'm not around to make you feel better about yourself"
"01","27","7","SANDY","oh you goin somewhere?"

"01","27","7","CALEB","what did you think I was doing in Vegas"
"01","27","7","SANDY","what besides flipping my restaurant for a tidy sum"
"01","27","7","CALEB","I was trying ta save the Newport group, selling that property was spose'ta keep this company from going bankrupt"
"01","27","7","SANDY","(stunned) w-well Kirsten never said anything"
"01","27","7","CALEB","that's because residential real estate is our only profitable division, she doesn't know anything about the bad investments, the debts...the losses"
"01","27","7","SANDY","so sell the property ta somebody else, Robert Campbell can't be the only buyer in town"
"01","27","7","CALEB","it doesn't mean as much to anyone else, Campbell owns the rest of the coast line, this property was the last piece of the puzzle that he was missing"
"01","27","7","SANDY","so that's why you wanted us outta the restaurant so fast, oh you sneaky (shakes his head) not so successful son of a bitch"

"01","27","8","MARISSA","an then you're left with nothing, you'd have'ta move to Phoenix, well at least this way I can still see you (smiles)"
"01","27","8","JIMMY","(shakes his head, sad) life jus wasn't this complicated when I was growin up"
"01","27","8","MARISSA","yeah I know, it feels like we're constantly being punished for something, an mom jus keeps on ticking"
"01","27","8","JIMMY","hey your mom has'ta wake up every morning an be Julie Cooper (Marissa smiles) that is punishment enough (looks at Marissa) c'mon lets take a break, what'do you say go down the pier an-an get a Balboa bar"

"02","01","2","SANDY","ooh so that's the problem, its not your smothering over protectiveness that kept him from ever having a friend until Ryan came along (Kirsten looks at him) sometimes the best thing for a kid is to have some space"
"02","01","2","KIRSTEN","(upset) the Pacific Ocean that's not enough space?"
"02","01","2","SANDY","if ya force him to come home he's gonna wanna run away again"

"02","01","13","SANDY","well right now it's...its not about what he knows (rubs Kirsten's arm) it's about how he feels"

"02","01","22","RYAN","no, I can't"
"02","01","22","THERESA","you should go if you wanna go"
"02","01","22","RYAN","it's for them to figure out, as a family"

"02","01","23","SANDY","an this comin from a guy who is one click away from wearin a wig an a fake moustache"
"02","01","23","CALEB","you think my paranoia is unfounded"
"02","01","23","SANDY","(smiles) it's entertaining but completely unfounded, I haven't heard anything from any'a my friends at the DA's office"
"02","01","23","CALEB","that doesn't make any sense, DA comes to see me at the beginning of summer, tells me the sky is falling...an he hasn't done a damn thing since"
"02","01","23","SANDY","well either they've realised they got nothin...or there building one hell of a case...I got a plane to catch (starts the car)"

"02","01","25","SETH","heeey, i'm sorry I missed that"
"02","01","25","SETH","yeah I don't know, jus wasn't up for it"
"02","01","25","LUKE","Cohen got in a little fight with his mom"
"02","01","25","SETH","(closes his eyes) thankyou, that was both honest an emasculating"
"02","01","25","SETH","I guess, its probably time to tell em about the home school plan"
"02","01","25","SETH","alright dude (holds out his hand)"
"02","01","26","SETH","don't drown...oh hey if you see anymore naked fat guys be sure an let Luke know, ok"
"02","01","27","LUKE","dude"
"02","01","27","SETH","yes"
"02","01","27","LUKE","you need'to close on Jane before the summers over"
"02","01","27","SETH","I live here so does she, there's plenty'a time"

"02","01","31","MARISSA","so have you talked ta Seth...or Ryan"
"02","01","31","KIRSTEN","I talked at Seth, if it qualifies as a conversation...Sandy saw Ryan last night he-he seems to be doing well"
"02","01","31","MARISSA","oh well that's good"
"02","01","31","KIRSTEN","do you guys still talk"
"02","01","31","MARISSA","uh...yeah not really, we use to but it jus sorto made everything harder (Kirsten nods) (Marissa leaves the room)"
"02","01","31","JIMMY","see, your kid doesn't need to be in Portland to be distant (rubs Kirsten's arm Kirsten sighs)"
"02","01","31","SANDY","well...didn't happen I-it's a long story but hey they have plenty'a good restaurants in Newport"
"02","01","31","SETH","I thought you said all the restaurants in Newport were over priced an over sauced"

"02","01","32","SETH","this isn't about you"

"02","01","32","SETH","ya can't spend my entire life telling me everything that's wrong with Newport an then just expect i'm gonna go back (shrugs) ya can't do that"
"02","01","32","SANDY","Newport is your home, like it or not, when your eighteen an you've saved up enough money you can move far away from the parents you resent an the town you loathe"
"02","01","32","SETH","ya let Ryan go, why not me?"

"02","01","47","SUMMER","my therapist said that it's uh my best chance at ever again vibrating at a high frequency"
"02","01","47","KIRSTEN","(confused) vibrating at a high frequency"
"02","01","47","SUMMER","Lynn Grabhorn (Kirsten still doesn't follow) excuse me your life is waiting...(explains) human beings have an electro-chemical currency running through us which is effected by our emotions, when your feeling happy or joyful that current or energy (Kirsten is listening) is vibrating at a higher frequency then when your feeling...sad or angry at lets say Seth Cohen, when your vibrating at a higher frequency your more likely to attract happy people then when you are vibrating at a low, sad, bitter at Cohen frequency, its the law of attraction and physics (picks up the crate)"
"02","01","47","KIRSTEN","you know where'to find his room"
"02","01","47","SUMMER","(on the stairs) thanks"

"02","01","52","RYAN","well its still a pretty big deal, I mean droppin outta school living up here"

"02","04","42","KIRSTEN","(worried) this is our star clientele, dy'know how many years of wooing an cajoling it took to have a meeting with these people"

"02","04","43","MARISSA","(unconvinced) ah-huh, well that sounds like its coming from a really...generous place (Summer gives Marissa a 'what would you know' look)"
"02","04","43","ZACH","or we could just put the Cohen obsession on hold and watch the band"
"02","04","43","SUMMER","(offended) I am not obsessing"
"02","04","43","ZACH","the seething, the staring, the analysing of his outfit, that's not obsessing?"

"02","05","54","CALEB","he said he had something that could save my hide, clearly he didn't share it with you"
"02","05","54","KIRSTEN","no he actually respects things like attourney client priviledge"
"02","05","55","SANDY","yeah I said call me, not come over"
"02","05","55","CALEB","I was in the neighbourhood"
"02","05","56","CALEB","so...what'a you got, what is this miraculous development"
"02","05","56","SANDY","I spoke with Renee Wheeler today I know about the affair"
"02","05","56","CALEB","what?"
"02","05","56","SANDY","relax, she didn't give ya up, why didn't ya tell me"
"02","05","56","CALEB","because the details of my personal life...have no bearing on this case"
"02","05","56","SANDY","oh yes they do, the DA thinks you've ben payin off Renee Wheeler to get building permits"
"02","05","56","CALEB","the DA's an idiot (moves away)"
"02","05","56","SANDY","(follows) even if you were havin an affair with this woman...sixteen years is an awfully long time ta be payin someone alimony...unless there was a child"
"02","05","56","CALEB","that is the most preposterous-"
"02","05","56","SANDY","Caleb?, was there a child"
"02","05","56","CALEB","...we were together just a few months (Sandy is listening) Renee came to me...said she was pregnant, I set up a trust (through the kitchen window we see Kirsten looking out) it was a long time ago Sandy (we see Kirsten again) I made a mistake"
"02","05","56","SANDY","well when you make a mistake...you really make a mistake"
"02","05","57","SANDY","first thing Monday morning you an Renee are gonna go to the judge an tell em everything"

"02","05","57","SANDY","(tries to get through to Caleb) your both lookin at jail time"
"02","05","57","CALEB","i'm sorry Sandy, I can't"
"02","05","58","SUMMER","(gives in) fine, but no talking"

"02","05","61","MARISSA","a year ago she wanted'ta have me committed cause I was dating you"
"02","05","61","RYAN","yeah an now somehow you've managed to find someone she hates even more"
"02","05","61","MARISSA","I know, can you imagine what she would've done if I brought DJ"
"02","05","61","RYAN","kinda...which is...why i'm suprised you didn't, you usually don't pass up a chance to ruin your moms night"
"02","05","61","MARISSA","yeah but why put DJ through that, I jus told him to come after"
"02","05","61","RYAN","so it's not because you're embarrassed"
"02","05","61","MARISSA","(looks at Ryan) I already told you, the winter ball it's...not his type'a thing"
"02","05","61","RYAN","did he decide that or did you"
"02","05","62","RYAN","figure we're probably the same size"
"02","05","62","MARISSA","(smiles) (softly) thanks (runs away then turns back) oh hey you sure your gonna be ok"

"02","09","76","ZACH","(smiles) tonight"
"02","09","76","SUMMER","fair enough (closes her eyes) its just that...my whole dating experience...(frowns) amounts to a six month angst fest with coo coo for Cohen (raises her eyebrows) (Zach looks down) so when i'm with you someone who is, sane an normal...its like I was raised by wolves"
"02","09","76","ZACH","...do you need the drama"
"02","09","76","SUMMER","well...if by that you mean do I miss the wolves...no (raises her eyebrows) see wolves they pee all over the place marking their territory...gross (Zach smiles) but...while i'm learning how to not howl...at the moon, I need to take baby steps...like this anniversary thing"
"02","09","76","ZACH","I get it...an don't worry, if we're still together when we hit the one year mark, i'm gonna totally blow it off"
"02","09","76","SUMMER","I think that is the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me (smiles)"

"02","09","77","SETH","yeah, I don't think you have'ta lump Lindsay in that category though, she's probably jus tryin'a let loose"
"02","09","77","RYAN","or Marissa pressured her into it"
"02","09","77","SETH","(reluctant) I think that if Lindsay was feelin any pressure it was probably comin from you (looks at Ryan) I mean ya kinda ? them inta that relationship? but I mean the girlfriend an the ex as friends, I think that goes against nature"
"02","09","77","RYAN","hm, sounds like someone could follow their own advice"

"02","13","13","SANDY","hey...do we have guests (Kirsten motions towards a card) (reads) special agent Jill Stonerock, the FBI was here"
"02","13","13","KIRSTEN","well it wouldn�t be the Cohen house if there wasn�t a visit from someone in law enforcement"
"02","13","13","SANDY","(almost accusingly) what'd you tell em"
"02","13","13","KIRSTEN","so now your cross examining me (Sandy shakes his head) I told them Professor Bloom came here two weeks ago an asked you to clear Rebecca�s name"
"02","13","13","SANDY","that�s it"
"02","13","13","KIRSTEN","you mean did I tell them where Rebecca is staying...no I did not"
"02","13","13","SANDY","I�m protected because I�m her lawyer (raises eyebrows) but if you withhold information your obstructing justice, you could be prosecuted"
"02","13","13","KIRSTEN","are you worried about me with holding information or telling them too much"
"02","13","13","SANDY","it�s not a choice between protecting you, an protecting Rebecca"
"02","13","13","KIRSTEN","oh I think it is, an I think you've made that choice Sandy"
"02","13","14","CALEB","what is it Julie I have alott'a work to do"
"02","13","14","JULIE","we need to talk about this"
"02","13","14","CALEB","if you mean about my adopting Lindsay I think you've made your position very clear"
"02","13","14","JULIE","oh you mean that I seem to be the only one trying to protect you"
"02","13","14","CALEB","as I recall, after my heart attack it was Lindsay at my bedside you were at a spa in Nice"
"02","13","14","JULIE","you can hold that against me for the rest of our lives but I am not going to let you rush inta this...now for starters an this may be painful, you need to redo the paternity test, the medical advancements in the past-"
"02","13","14","CALEB","there was no paternity test"
"02","13","14","JULIE","(shocked) what"
"02","13","14","CALEB","there was no need"
"02","13","14","JULIE","you�re kidding"
"02","13","14","CALEB","do I need to tell you how transparent your motives are"
"02","13","14","JULIE","after all the money you've paid out over these years with no proof, I jus thought you were a better business man then that"
"02","13","14","CALEB","Renee is an honest woman"
"02","13","14","JULIE","the kind of honest woman who has an affair with a married man (Caleb looks down) (sighs) look, Lindsay...probably is your daughter but don�t you think you have a responsibility (Caleb looks at her) ta this family you�re sure about before diving inta this"
"02","13","14","CALEB","ill think about it"

"02","13","15","SUMMER","party at Caleb�s, that sounds awesome yes (claps) maybe a little shuffle board (Marissa looks down) a little bingo"
"02","13","15","MARISSA","(smiles) I jus thought you'd help keep me company that�s all"

"02","13","17","JULIE","look no one is suggesting that Caleb isn�t the father I mean after all you would've said something right, all these years you've ben taking his money (Renee looks at her) ...god otherwise that would be like fraud wouldn�t it"
"02","13","17","JULIE","oh nothing, nothing at all just...well if you do have any doubts, about how the test might affect Lindsay...maybe this adoption isn�t such a great idea, I�m sure you could come up with a diplomatic way to talk her out of it"
"02","13","17","LINDSAY","(calls out) mom who�s there (comes to the door) Julie"
"02","13","17","JULIE","(smiles) Lindsay, I jus came by to remind your mom about the party tomorrow night, I hope she can make it"

"02","13","24","SANDY","so you didn�t do a test when Renee got pregnant"
"02","13","24","CALEB","no I didn�t, it was an affair I was trying to save my marriage the last thing I wanted was a medical record of my infidelity"
"02","13","24","SANDY","yeah for seventeen years you've ben fine payin the bills now on the day your gonna announce her to the world, all of a sudden you want proof, how'dya think Lindsay�s gonna take this"
"02","13","24","CALEB","I would think she would wanna know the truth as much as I do"
"02","13","24","SANDY","oh cut it out, she thinks she�s gettin a father...not a blood test (Caleb stands) you brought me here for my legal opinion here it is, ask for the test, you know your a wealthy man with a large family you'd be irresponsible to do otherwise (Caleb nods) but as a father (stands) I say ask yourself if you love the girl, if you do...nothin else matters"

"02","16","36","SANDY","ah with Carter Buckley"
"02","16","36","KIRSTEN","actually without (Sandy listens) it turns out that Newport Living wasn't for him after all, when he didn't show up for work yesterday I went by his place an I found him...drowning in self pity and...Tequila"
"02","16","36","SANDY","only a couple'a weeks in Newport an already his spirit is crushed, I never would'a thought that'd be possible, here's a guy who built the whole magazine around people who fought the system, no matter the cost (Kirsten looks at him, thinking) the guy was an inspiration to me (stands)"
"02","16","36","KIRSTEN","you know uh that magazine of his, that you loved in college, do you happen to have a copy"
"02","16","36","SANDY","revolution, yeah I probably do, it's probably in the office or y'know maybe the garage"
"02","16","36","SETH","hey man, how'd it go last night with Marissa"
"02","16","36","RYAN","things with Marissa went great (sighs)"
"02","16","36","SETH","good"
"02","16","36","RYAN","mm...things with Alex (looks at Seth) no so much"
"02","16","36","SETH","(looks at Ryan then turns away) Alex was there"
"02","16","36","RYAN","yeah, she threw a beer can at my head"
"02","16","36","SETH","what"
"02","16","36","RYAN","then shoved me a couple times, yeah pretty hard actually"
"02","16","36","SETH","that is one angry lesbian"
"02","16","37","SETH","ok, here's the thing...I may have accidentally let a little something slip about you know"
"02","16","37","RYAN","a tent"
"02","16","37","SETH","no I didn't, yeah ok maybe, yes I did but I don't understand why she's makin such a big deal out of it, like there's somethin dirty about camping"
"02","16","37","RYAN","an before Alex an I had our friendly little chat Marissa (Seth raises his eyebrows and walks away) mentioned that it was your idea that we work on the bonfire together"
"02","16","37","SETH","uh I might've ben the one ta mention it but I don't think I should hog all the credit"
"02","16","37","RYAN","(means it) stay out of it...just cause your back with Summer doesn't mean me an Marissa"
"02","16","37","SETH","I know (Ryan looks at him) you were jus a lot happier back then ok so"
"02","16","37","RYAN","well that was then"
"02","16","37","SETH","alright"
"02","16","39","RYAN","hey uh I'm not gonna be able ta make it tonight (Marissa closes her eyes) but uh the woods ordered and you have the plans so everything should be fine, have fun"
"02","16","40","ALEX","who was that"
"02","16","40","MARISSA","(looks at Alex) oh, my mom (shrugs) more empty threats"
"02","16","40","ALEX","(moves closer) you were asleep last night when I got home"
"02","16","40","MARISSA","yeah, yeah I was really tired"
"02","16","40","ALEX","(sits) you should try sleeping in a tent, with Ryan (Marissa looks at her) (closes her eyes) oh but you (opens her eyes) already did that"
"02","16","40","MARISSA","(closes her eyes) look I'm sorry I was goin'a tell you that its jus, I didn't wanna make it a big deal"
"02","16","40","ALEX","well it wasn't until you lied"
"02","16","40","MARISSA","I didn't lie (Alex looks at her) I just-"
"02","16","40","ALEX","lied (Marissa doesn't say anything) (softly, hurt) no big deal (walks back up the hallway)"
"02","16","41","JULIE","please tell me you have some good news"
"02","16","41","SANDY","well unfortunately Lance is as sleazy as he looks, but not as dumb (stands) he owns the rights to the movie in perpetuity an you were a consenting adult when it was shot so if he wants to make money off it it's his prerogative"
"02","16","41","JULIE","Sandy, there's gotta be some way to stop him"
"02","16","41","SANDY","yeah we could charge him with extortion (shrugs) an get an injunction but that would involve the authorities"
"02","16","41","JULIE","no, even if I paid him off there's nothing to stop him from leaking it anyway"
"02","16","41","SANDY","look ill figure somethin out, you worry about Marissa ill handle the rest"
"02","16","41","JULIE","I can worry all I want, doesn't seem to help anything, why is it that the one person who knows what's best for their child is the last person that child wants to hear from"
"02","16","41","SANDY","yeah we had a similar situation with Seth last summer an...all I can say is that sometimes it's not the message...it's the messenger"
"02","16","42","SUMMER","I don't know Coop, it sounds like a pretty bad fight I mean (shrugs) maybe you should just move home"
"02","16","42","MARISSA","I can't"
"02","16","42","SUMMER","because you love Alex an where ever she is that's your home"
"02","16","42","MARISSA","cause it would make my mom too happy"
"02","16","42","SUMMER","oh"
"02","16","42","MARISSA","god, what was I thinking"
"02","16","42","SUMMER","well ya cant go to the bonfire with Ryan, then go home to Alex (shrugs) you cant ride two horses with one ass (Marissa looks at her) its a proverb (pushes Marissa's head to face forward again)"
"02","16","42","MARISSA","ok well Ryan's not going ta the bonfire"
"02","16","42","SUMMER","what why, I thought it was like his idea"
"02","16","42","MARISSA","he didn't say but I know it's because of Alex"
"02","16","42","SUMMER","I mean I'm confused I thought Alex wasn't going"
"02","16","42","MARISSA","she's not (raises eyebrows) but Ryan an I were working late at the apartment the other night and well somehow she found out about the mall an the tent (Summer frowns) and well I hadn't exactly told her about it"
"02","16","42","SUMMER","(frowns) well if you didn't tell her then who did"
"02","16","42","MARISSA","mm (shrugs)"
"02","16","42","SUMMER","(realises) oh I am going ta kick his ass back to last year (leaves)"
"02","16","42","MARISSA","whoa hello Summer (touches her hair) who's ass"
"02","16","42","RYAN","not now Seth I'm (we hear the door open) busy"

"02","16","42","RYAN","(now standing) yeah an right now I'm in the middle of a major session so if you could jus (Julie looks at him) ...what's goin on"
"02","16","42","JULIE","well actually (moves closer) I'm very glad that I caught you before you go to the bonfire"
"02","16","42","RYAN","ah-ha (smiles) I'm not goin to the bonfire"
"02","16","42","JULIE","oh but you have'ta go"
"02","16","42","RYAN","what're you an Seth workin on the same team now"
"02","16","42","JULIE","no I'm on my own mission I need help...with Marissa (Ryan listens) for whatever reason that I don't quite understand...she listens to you...she needs help"
"02","16","42","RYAN","maybe she's happy where she is"
"02","16","42","JULIE","do you honestly think that Marissa knows what she wants right now, she is in so far over her head with this relationship, she's skipping school she's staying out all hours risking everything that's important to her jus to prove a point"
"02","16","42","RYAN","ok, so what'do you want me ta do about it"
"02","16","42","JULIE","well I know that she wants ta come home, but if she does it for me its like she's letting me win, but if she does it for you-"
"02","16","42","RYAN","no I'm not getting in the middle of Marissa's life...alright, not again, an especially her relationship with Alex"
"02","16","42","JULIE","this is not about Alex, its about Marissa and her future which we can both see is slipping away from her (Ryan listens) Ryan please help me...convince her to come home...(softly) you know that's what's for the best"
"02","16","43","ALEX","what the hell are you doing here"
"02","16","43","RYAN","(pushes in) I'm lookin for Marissa"
"02","16","43","ALEX","this is you staying away"

"02","23","28","SETH","you have'ta go, an look, I mean maybe I've seen too many saved by the bells but if its taught me anything it sure has taught me that prom is a seminal moment, ok, its meant to be shared (looks at Ryan)"

"03","01","27","JIMMY","yeah well at least somebody has their priorities in order..."
"03","01","27","JULIE","(sighs) I just hope Marissa listens to me, and our attorney, the last thing we need is her admitting ta the DA that she shot someone"

"03","03","42","SETH","well maybe if we don't push at all we'll never see her again"
"03","03","42","SANDY","(walking away) you know the situations a little too complicated for those snide comments"

"03","05","57","MARISSA","ok true (laughs) but Ryan's is really screwed up, an he's got a chance ta be difference than them if he'd jus take it"
"03","05","57","MARISSA","(walking up the stairs) oh I don't think he'll listen ta me, infact I don't know who he'll listen to"
"03","05","58","JULIE","(looks over) no (walks inside) Julie Cooper-Nichol (smiles)"
"03","05","58","JULIE","door was open so I thought id take a little peek around, gave me a chance ta really visualise myself in the place (looks at her) ill take it"

"03","05","61","SUMMER","why do you think I'm writing this letter"
"03","05","61","SETH","are you starting a petition, that's a pretty good idea"
"03","05","61","SUMMER","no it's not a petition dumb ass I'm begging for Taylor's forgiveness"
"03","05","61","SETH","hm you had me an then you...I think you lost me (smiles)"
"03","05","61","SUMMER","ok, if Taylor thinks that dean Hess is sorry maybe they'll get back together an then we can expose them an use that as a leverage (raises eyebrows) ta get Ryan back in school"
"03","05","61","SETH","(takes it all in) huh"

"03","05","65","SETH","he could be off joining a foreign legion, joining a cult...Ryan could be...(shakes head) I don't know he could be takin place in a mass marriage right now drinkin cool aide from brand new sneakers...so many sick things"

"03","14","12","RYAN","maybe thatt's for the best (frowns) I mean she screwed up but she's still pretty much a kid so"
"03","14","12","MARISSA","(nods) yeah, but with my moms DNA, which means she's capable (squints) of more than you think (looks at Ryan)"

"03","14","13","KAITLIN","(sits up) as long as we're skippin the water part, why don't we jus do this back at your place (Johnny looks at her) or we could jus blow the whole thing off, rent a movie, order in pancakes"

"03","14","14","SANDY","right, now we have'ta ply more people with women an liquor"
"03","14","14","SANDY","then we got that in common, call it willful naivety, call it bleary eyed optimism"
"03","14","14","SANDY","yeah, there's over a hundred thousand uninsured that live in Orange County, there's got to be some angle we can find to make that land on these guys"
"03","14","14","SANDY","(looks at Matt) well now there's a shocking turn of events"

"03","14","17","RYAN","well (sighs) not that that's any of your business but it's not the case"
"03","14","17","KAITLIN","I don't know, see, today I asked her if she had feelings for him, point blank (Ryan looks at her) she didn't deny it"
"03","14","18","RYAN","(nods, had enough) well thanks for the heads up (touches Kaitlin's shoulder) I think Marissa an I can handle it ourselves so, if you jus wanna (points to the open doors)"
"03","14","18","KAITLIN","Ryan I want you to do something about it (Ryan puts his hands on his hips) I mean you're a man of action, you throw punches, set fires (Ryan folds his arms) at least that's the guy I remember from two years ago"
"03","14","18","RYAN","m we've all grown up since then (smiles)"
"03","14","18","KAITLIN","so your reformed now, congratulations, it doesn't mean you still can't talk to her"

"03","14","19","RYAN","(sighs) but that's not the whole story is it (Marissa looks at him wide eyed) look (closes eyes, opens them) maybe...you jus feel sorry for him or...maybe sometimes you didn't think you could talk to me (Marissa looks away) or I wasn't listening (Marissa looks down) or maybe your in love with him (Marissa looks at him) either way you gotta figure it out an until then I...I don't wanna see you"
"03","14","20","MARISSA","(blinks) look I know things have been confusing"
"03","14","21","SETH","hey, morning"

"03","20","115","KIRSTEN","(goes over to Sandy) do you forget that I worked at that company for fifteen years an I saw what happened to my father"
"03","20","115","SANDY","(shakes head) I'm not gonna become your father, but I can't just quit"
"03","21","0","KIRSTEN","Nice job on the grill, Seth. Those swordfish look perfect."
"03","21","0","SANDY","Wow, the student becomes a master. There's a new king of the B-B-Q. I cede you my oven mitts."
"03","21","0","SETH","And here I thought I was destined to live in your shadow. See, buddy? No need to become a fisherman after all."
"03","21","0","RYAN","Yeah, that was a bad idea."
"03","21","0","SETH","We all have our moments."
"03","21","0","RYAN","You mean like you lying to Summer and breaking up with her to cover it up?"
"03","21","0","SETH","No, actually, I think that was a great idea."
"03","21","0","SETH","Exactly."
"03","21","0","RYAN","Yeah."
"03","21","0","SANDY","What are you guys talking about?"
"03","21","0","SETH","Nothing."
"03","21","0","RYAN","Nothing."
"03","21","0","KIRSTEN","Ryan, I don't know if you saw, but your graduation tickets came."
"03","21","0","SANDY","Aisle seats. Nice! Although you'd think after sending two kids to Harbor, they could cough up more than two tickets per student."
"03","21","0","KIRSTEN","He's just worried about the Nana."
"03","21","0","SETH","Well, she is an excellent clapper."
"03","21","0","SANDY","She can do the two-finger whistle."
"03","21","0","KIRSTEN","She's never taken a picture out of focus."
"03","21","0","SANDY","The woman was born for graduations."
"03","21","0","RYAN","Well, let her take my tickets. I mean, Seth's got you guys covered. I'd hate to see mine go to waste."
"03","21","0","KIRSTEN","Why don't you invite someone from your family? Your mom would love it."
"03","21","0","RYAN","I'm going to go wash up."
"03","21","0","SETH","Sink's right here, uh..."
"03","21","0","SANDY","I don't think it's such a good idea, honey. I tried this already."
"03","21","0","KIRSTEN","She signed up for AA. She's starting her life again."
"03","21","0","SANDY","Yeah, after writing bad checks and getting arrested and disappearing."
"03","21","0","SANDY","She doesn't have the greatest track record."
"03","21","0","SETH","I think I'm going to wash up, too."
"03","21","0","KIRSTEN","It's important to him."
"03","21","0","SANDY","I just don't want to see him get hurt again."
"03","21","0","KIRSTEN","It's his decision."
"03","21","0","SANDY","Well, he's still a kid."
"03","21","0","KIRSTEN","Right. Because when we get older, we make much better decisions."
"03","21","1","KIRSTEN","I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to..."
"03","21","1","RYAN","No, it's fine, it's fine. It's something I've been thinking about for a long time. I haven't seen her in so long. If I don't invite her to graduation, will I ever see her again?"
"03","21","1","KIRSTEN","Look, I know the last time she was here, it was difficult."
"03","21","1","RYAN","When Sandy saw her, how was she?"
"03","21","1","KIRSTEN","Honestly, not good, but she's trying. Maybe seeing you again will be just the thing for both of you."
"03","21","1","RYAN","What if she's worse?"
"03","21","1","KIRSTEN","There's only one way to find out... and if you want me to fly to Albuquerque with you..."
"03","21","1","RYAN","If I do this, I need to do it alone. But you're right. You're right. She's my mom. I owe her a chance. How bad can it be, right?"
"03","21","1","KIRSTEN","Right."
"03","21","2","MARISSA","What are you doing in here?"
"03","21","2","MARISSA","Oh, really? 'Cause Mima's from the Philippines."
"03","21","2","MARISSA","I survived. Okay. W-We can't do this, okay?"
"03","21","2","MARISSA","No, it's not that. It's just..."
"03","21","2","JULIE","Her mother might find out. You know, I told Neil this house had rats."
"03","21","2","JULIE","Keep that grimy paw away from me, unless you want to see what ten years of cardio bar can do to your face."
"03","21","2","JULIE","I guess I was just a phase."
"03","21","2","MARISSA","Spare me the lecture."
"03","21","2","JULIE","Oh, no lecture. I get it. He's cool, he's got great abs... and personifies everything that's bad for you, Marissa."
"03","21","2","MARISSA","Oh, so you want to sleep with him instead?"
"03","21","2","JULIE","Marissa, the choices you make now are going to affect your future."
"03","21","2","MARISSA","He's not that bad. Look, you were wrong about Ryan. Maybe you're wrong about him."
"03","21","2","JULIE","Well, we're not going to test that theory, because I'm not going to allow it."
"03","21","3","KIRSTEN","I went completely overboard and made you a ridiculously gigantic sandwich for the flight."
"03","21","3","RYAN","Thanks. Looking forward to it."
"03","21","3","KIRSTEN","And I booked you a car service to go anywhere and everywhere."
"03","21","3","RYAN","No, that's all right. I can take a cab."
"03","21","3","KIRSTEN","Just humor me. I worry enough."
"03","21","3","RYAN","All right. Actually, I'm a little worried, too. I, uh... I didn't get a lot of sleep last night."
"03","21","3","KIRSTEN","Do you have a game plan when you get there?"
"03","21","3","RYAN","Yeah... I guess. Uh, she mentioned in her birthday card some diner she's working at. I figure I show up and... say hi and wait for the fireworks."
"03","21","3","KIRSTEN","Well, whatever happens, you have at least one proud mother watching you when you graduate."
"03","21","3","RYAN","Yeah, thanks."
"03","21","4","TAYLOR","Hey, Sum. If it makes you feel any better, I just saw Seth, and he looks as miserable as you do."
"03","21","4","SUMMER","The only thing that would make me feel better would be seeing that assless, gutless wuss skinned, flayed and served as assless, gutless wuss tartare."
"03","21","4","TAYLOR","Oh, well, that's very descriptive, Summer."
"03","21","4","SUMMER","All right, look, T. to the T., I know you're all up with life, down with God, and you have a very positive, optimistic view on the world, but I ain't having it."
"03","21","4","TAYLOR","Summer, I'm not trying to offer you anything other than my friendship... but you know, I mean, if you want to be alone, that's totally okay with me, too."
"03","21","4","SUMMER","How could he lead me on and agree that we should plan our futures around being together and then just decide, ""Oh, you know what? Yeah, maybe we shouldn't. We're not destined for each other."" That I should just go ship off to Rhode Island all alone. I'm literally going to be deserted on an island."
"03","21","4","TAYLOR","Well, technically, Rhode Island is only bordered on three sides by water, so... It was an awful thing to do."
"03","21","4","SUMMER","And to think... just two years ago, he stood up on that very coffee cart and declared his love for me."
"03","21","4","TAYLOR","That was so sweet. You didn't see me, but I was there... and I remember that geek was totally in love with you."
"03","21","4","SUMMER","And I have only gotten hotter since then. Something is up. A guy like Cohen is physically incapable of walking away from a girl like me, unless he is hiding something. And no one hides anything from me. I'm going to get to the bottom of this, and no one is going to stop me. Thank you so much for a pep talk."
"03","21","5","SANDY","Why don't you get it in a to-go cup?"
"03","21","5","SANDY","You're not happy to see me?"
"03","21","5","SANDY","What's this?"
"03","21","5","SANDY","You want me to pay you?"
"03","21","5","SANDY","You're talking blackmail; it's not even noon yet."
"03","21","5","SANDY","You're getting yourself in pretty deep here, Matt."
"03","21","6","MARISSA","No, I came to see you."
"03","21","6","MARISSA","Actually, I was thinking maybe you'd want to hang out."
"03","21","6","MARISSA","Second semester, senior year. Unless you don't want to."
"03","21","7","RYAN","Uh, actually, I'm looking for someone-- uh, Dawn Atwood?"
"03","21","7","RYAN","A friend. Um, I'm staying at La Crescenta, I think."
"03","21","7","RYAN","I got a good rate."
"03","21","7","RYAN","Ryan."
"03","21","7","RYAN","I hope not. Uh, couple hours, you said ? Great. Uh, I'll be back."
"03","21","7","RYAN","Okay."
"03","21","8","SUMMER","Seth, you are so funny! I'm sorry, that was just such a knee slapper."
"03","21","8","SUMMER","No, no. Um, well, not unless you're insulted by Seth's impersonation of you behind your back, involving penguin-walking buck teeth and crossed eyes."
"03","21","8","SETH","Uh, no, no. I... don't do any impressions."
"03","21","9","SETH","What is your deal, woman? I've never been thrown out of a class in my whole life."
"03","21","9","SUMMER","Okay, sorry to tarnish your perfect record, Cohen, but how else was I going to talk to you? The breakup is off. That's right. I broke up with you, and technically, it's in my power to technically un-break us up."
"03","21","9","SETH","You can do that?"
"03","21","9","SUMMER","Technically, I just did. So unless you can explain to my satisfaction what your deal is and why you suddenly don't want to be together next year, we're back on. Yeah, technically, officially, completely."
"03","21","9","SETH","Okay, now..."
"03","21","10","RYAN","I don't think so."
"03","21","10","RYAN","Sounds good."
"03","21","11","JULIE","Marissa!"
"03","21","11","MARISSA","Oh, my God, it's my mom."
"03","21","11","MARISSA","Good, 'cause I'm going to hide."
"03","21","11","JULIE","Where's my daughter? Is she in here?"
"03","21","11","JULIE","Don't get smart with me; you don't have the equipment. Her school called. She didn't show up today."
"03","21","11","JULIE","Listen up, Tommy Lee, you're just the latest in a series of experiments my daughter likes to make when acting out, so enjoy it, because right here, right now is as good as it gets for you. Soon, Marissa's going to wake up and realize she is so much better than you and your life."
"03","21","11","JULIE","Marissa knows that I will be there for her whenever she decides to come home, because I am her family and not some punk with a smirk, three brain cells and a good coke connection. You tell her that."
"03","21","11","MARISSA","That's my mom."
"03","21","12","RYAN","Best not to tell my mom about the beer."
"03","21","12","RYAN","Good idea."
"03","21","12","RYAN","Yeah, well, I'm working up to it. I don't know how much you know, but my mom and I haven't always had the easiest relationship."
"03","21","12","RYAN","Yeah, I saw that. She seemed happy. There was a tattooed guy that made me a little nervous."
"03","21","12","RYAN","That's what I was afraid of."
"03","21","12","RYAN","Yeah. They all do at first."
"03","21","12","RYAN","Um..."
"03","21","12","RYAN","I don't really... dance so much. I, uh... This is not what I expected."
"03","21","13","SANDY","What can I say? I'm very charming. Close the door."
"03","21","13","SANDY","Matt's not giving up, and since you had nothing to do with the ass-kicking he took, the news shouldn't get your blood up."
"03","21","13","SANDY","Money... in exchange for the incriminating files, which you claim couldn't possibly be incriminating. You know what-- I'm going to let the cops deal with the whole thing."
"03","21","13","SANDY","No. I'm making Matt my problem."
"03","21","14","RYAN","Yeah, good plan."
"03","21","14","RYAN","Yeah, something like that."
"03","21","15","RYAN","Hello."
"03","21","15","SETH","Hey, man. How's Albuquerque?"
"03","21","15","RYAN","Well, I did just hook up with a waitress."
"03","21","15","SETH","Oh, that would never happen to me, you stallion. Y tu madre?"
"03","21","15","RYAN","Uh, doesn't know I'm here. Actually, I'm thinking about taking an earlier flight back."
"03","21","15","SETH","You can't just fly all the way to New Mexico and not even say hi to your mom."
"03","21","15","RYAN","Yeah? You really want to meet her trucker boyfriend and his python at graduation?"
"03","21","15","SETH","So don't invite anybody to anything. Just do a quick pop in, say hello. What's the worst that can happen?"
"03","21","15","RYAN","Not a question I want answered."
"03","21","15","SETH","Just be a man. Someone around here ought to."
"03","21","15","RYAN","You still lying to everyone about everything?"
"03","21","15","SETH","I'm trying to speak as little as possible. The less I say, the fewer lies I have to track, but Summer wants answers. I'm telling you, though, if I tell her the truth, she'll throw away her future over me."
"03","21","15","RYAN","Yeah, well, sounds like we both have women to face."
"03","21","15","SETH","Each who suffers blackouts of their own kind."
"03","21","15","RYAN","Well, good luck."
"03","21","15","SETH","You, too."
"03","21","16","RYAN","Hi."
"03","21","17","SUMMER","What are we doing tonight? Since we're dating again, we should go on a date."
"03","21","17","SETH","Except, uh, since you un-broke up with me, it sort of put the ball back in my court... and... now I break up with you, which means only I have the power to un-break us up."
"03","21","17","SUMMER","You're breaking up with me?"
"03","21","17","SETH","Yes. I'm sorry. I really am, but I feel it's for the best."
"03","21","17","SUMMER","What? I... I only un-broke up with you so that I could find out why you were breaking up with me in the first place."
"03","21","17","SETH","Well, I guess now you'll never know."
"03","21","18","RYAN","So do you, Mom."
"03","21","18","RYAN","Oh, she told you I was here?"
"03","21","18","RYAN","Yeah? She told you about the graduation, too?"
"03","21","18","RYAN","Hey, you know what? You're busy. Let's talk tomorrow."
"03","21","18","RYAN","It's good to see you, too."
"03","21","19","MARISSA","The party's starting a little early."
"03","21","19","MARISSA","Hey, Heather, it's good to see you, too."
"03","21","21","RYAN","Morning."
"03","21","21","RYAN","You don't have to buy anything, Mom."
"03","21","21","RYAN","Uh, hang on."
"03","21","21","RYAN","Yeah, yeah, sure."
"03","21","21","RYAN","She's very excited."
"03","21","21","RYAN","Yeah, totally."
"03","21","22","SUMMER","No way. No scheming, no plan Bs, no wacky hijinks. Cohen broke up with me. Only he has the power to un-break us up. There's no way I'm going to go groveling back to him like some pathetic, brokenhearted little bitch."
"03","21","22","TAYLOR","Do you still love him?"
"03","21","22","SUMMER","Yeah. There's something wrong with me, huh?"
"03","21","22","TAYLOR","Did he say that he doesn't love you?"
"03","21","22","SUMMER","Now that you mention it, no, he did not."
"03","21","22","TAYLOR","You see? He's acting out of fear. He's trapped in an anxiety spiral, and in the Rock, Paper, Scissors of romance, love trumps fear. Actually, love trumps everything."
"03","21","22","SUMMER","So, let's just say, for conversation's sake, I was open to a little scheming."
"03","21","22","TAYLOR","Well... I have an idea."
"03","21","23","SETH","You didn't get into Brown, too, did you? Hey, Taylor, what's up?"
"03","21","23","TAYLOR","Listen, I just wanted to let you know that detention today is being held in the student lounge."
"03","21","23","SETH","And you're telling me this because...?"
"03","21","23","TAYLOR","Because it's my job as a Harbor Student Proctor. I'm supervising detention this week."
"03","21","23","SETH","How is that any better than having actual detention?"
"03","21","23","TAYLOR","Seth, student lounge. And don't be late, or I will have to give you a tardy."
"03","21","24","SANDY","Hey, honey."
"03","21","24","KIRSTEN","You left early this morning, without saying good-bye."
"03","21","24","SANDY","Well, I didn't want to wake you."
"03","21","24","KIRSTEN","And last night when you came in?"
"03","21","24","SANDY","It was late."
"03","21","24","KIRSTEN","I need you home tonight, Sandy. We have to talk. I just feel like we're so disconnected right now."
"03","21","24","KIRSTEN","Thanks. I'll see you then."
"03","21","24","SANDY","I'll see you."
"03","21","25","SANDY","Oh, you should stop celebrating and start packing. I spoke to Griffin. He's not interested in your deal."
"03","21","25","SANDY","You called him?"
"03","21","25","SANDY","And the only thing he's willing to do is go round two on your skull."
"03","21","25","SANDY","He can't be trusted, Matt. If anybody should know that, you should."
"03","21","25","SANDY","You willing to bet on that?"
"03","21","26","MARISSA","She's having fun."
"03","21","26","MARISSA","Yeah, well, I'm not wasted."
"03","21","27","SUMMER","Hey. Got ten bucks?"
"03","21","27","SETH","What are you doing?"
"03","21","27","SUMMER","I know you're afraid, Cohen."
"03","21","27","SETH","Yeah, that you're going to fall... Don't go up there."
"03","21","27","SUMMER","Your breakup was missing a key ingredient. The only ingredient, really."
"03","21","27","SETH","Which is?"
"03","21","27","SUMMER","That you don't love me anymore."
"03","21","27","SETH","Summer..."
"03","21","27","SUMMER","Look... I love you this much, and I want to be with you now, and next year, and whatever comes after that. So I'm asking, in the presence of this coffee cart and the sacred moment that it represents... if you can honestly tell me that you don't love me anymore."
"03","21","27","SETH","Summer..."
"03","21","27","SUMMER","Just say it. Cohen, if you don't love me, I promise I will go to Brown by myself, and I will be cold and miserable and alone. I will never bother you again."
"03","21","27","SETH","I don't love you anymore."
"03","21","27","SUMMER","Oh, my God."
"03","21","27","SETH","Summer..."
"03","21","27","SUMMER","Just get away from me, okay? Just get out of here, Cohen!"
"03","21","27","TAYLOR","I'm so sorry..."
"03","21","27","SUMMER","I've got to go to detention."
"03","21","28","MARISSA","Hey, Heather. Hey. I'm glad I found you guys. Um, I left my jacket in the van. Volchok said you had the keys."
"03","21","28","MARISSA","Yeah, true, but it's my favorite jacket, so... Hey, get off of me. Heather!"
"03","21","28","MARISSA","Heather!"
"03","21","28","MARISSA","Oh, my God! Get off of her!"
"03","21","28","MARISSA","Get off of her! Oh, God! Get out!"
"03","21","29","RYAN","Yeah! One sec. Hey, Mom. I was going to go look for you at the diner."
"03","21","29","RYAN","Okay."
"03","21","29","RYAN","Uh, you know what? I, uh, I don't have the time right now. Yeah, yeah, I, uh, I got an earlier flight. Mom, um... I was talking to Seth, and, you know, graduation is just a ceremony. I mean, everybody in those funny hats, a bunch of boring speeches..."
"03","21","29","RYAN","Yeah. We were thinking about just blowing it off, you know, getting out of town that weekend."
"03","21","29","RYAN","Yeah, but, you know, I mean, you could... come in later in the summer and visit me, or I could come up here..."
"03","21","29","RYAN","No. No, I guess not."
"03","21","29","RYAN","Mom..."
"03","21","30","RYAN","Look, you don't know her the way I do, okay?"
"03","21","30","RYAN","It's been the same thing my whole life. She gets clean for a little while, promises she's changed, and then she meets some lowlife, he moves in with her, she bottoms out."
"03","21","30","RYAN","Yeah, well, I didn't know that."
"03","21","30","RYAN","I've got to get to the airport. The car's waiting."
"03","21","32","SANDY","Just as well, since there are no files. The only evidence Matt has is of his own bad judgment."
"03","21","32","SANDY","Go check the car yourself. After we spoke, I had your hard drive searched, checked your emails. You never had any evidence. Whatever you think Griffin was up to was based purely on gossip and hearsay."
"03","21","32","SANDY","Yeah, think about all the sick people you could be healing."
"03","21","32","SANDY","Your severance. It might not buy you that beach in Cabo, but it'll get you on your feet in Chicago."
"03","21","32","SANDY","I put you on this path, Matt. Take it and go."
"03","21","33","SETH","Hey, Mom."
"03","21","33","KIRSTEN","Hey. Where have you been? It's late."
"03","21","33","SETH","Uh, Full Metal Yaku is on, and 99 Cycling Swords."
"03","21","33","KIRSTEN","Those are movies?"
"03","21","33","SETH","I thought a few hours of mindless bloodshed and violence might help kill the pain."
"03","21","33","KIRSTEN","You want to talk?"
"03","21","33","SETH","I was going to actually ask you if you've seen Ryan."
"03","21","33","KIRSTEN","Not yet."
"03","21","33","SETH","Okay."
"03","21","33","KIRSTEN","Everything okay?"
"03","21","33","SETH","Yeah, everything's okay."
"03","21","33","KIRSTEN","Okay."
"03","21","33","SETH","Good night."
"03","21","33","KIRSTEN","Night."
"03","21","34","RYAN","I'm sorry."
"03","21","34","RYAN","But you didn't."
"03","21","34","RYAN","I guess I know the feeling."
"03","21","34","RYAN","I don't know about that. I may live in Newport, but, uh... I'm still your kid, after all."
"03","21","34","RYAN","Yeah."
"03","21","34","RYAN","I promise."
"03","21","35","RYAN","It's okay. Your little family intervention seems to have worked."
"03","21","35","RYAN","Me, either. And, uh... But my ride's here. I have a flight to catch."
"03","21","35","RYAN","All right, yeah. Sounds good."
"03","21","36","MARISSA","Mom?"
"03","21","36","JULIE","Marissa, honey."
"03","21","37","TAYLOR","You want me to whip up another round of frappuccinos? They say chocolate and sugar send endorphins to your brain. Come on, tell me you feel better."
"03","21","37","SUMMER","He doesn't love me."
"03","21","38","SETH","Welcome back, buddy. How was your mom?"
"03","21","38","RYAN","Coming to graduation. You really waiting here to ask about my mom?"
"03","21","38","SETH","I think I made the worst mistake of my entire life. Now I need to get Summer back, and I have to get into Brown."
"03","21","38","RYAN","Great. How?"
"03","21","38","SETH","That's where you come in."
"03","21","38","RYAN","We need a plan?"
"03","21","38","SETH","It's going to be a long night, Ryan. A lot of whining, a lot of pining. Maybe some brainstorming. You don't mind?"
"03","21","38","RYAN","It's good to be home. All right, how are we going to get you Summer back?"
"03","21","38","SETH","Plan A."
"03","21","38","RYAN","Yeah."
"03","21","38","SETH","I fake my own death. You never want to underestimate the power of the sympathy vote."
"03","21","38","RYAN","Is there a plan B?"
"03","21","38","SETH","Yeah, yeah, uh, I could hack in... through the Brown firewall into the, uh, Admissions Office mainframe and reverse my acceptance."
"03","21","38","RYAN","Wow, that's actually a good idea. You know how to do that?"
"03","21","38","SETH","I had an uncle who went to Devry."
"03","22","0","SETH","You taking all that? You only own, like, a wife beater and two hoodies."
"03","22","0","RYAN","I'm sorry, okay, I don't know what people wear to prospective students weekend, so I just brought everything."
"03","22","0","SETH","I'm packing light. Want to be free and easy for pre-frosh weekend."
"03","22","0","RYAN","Even though you're not a pre-freshman?"
"03","22","0","SETH","It's called ""pre-frosh,"" Ryan, and if I'm going to go there, I need you to get the lingo."
"03","22","0","SETH","Don't give me that sideways look. You were way into this plan when we came up with it."
"03","22","0","RYAN","That's 'cause we only had the beginning. So, um... you're going to fly to Brown..."
"03","22","0","SETH","And then I will somehow get them to admit me. Yeah, I don't have the, uh, the details yet, but... Brown's a spiritual place. I'll go, I'll get a vibe. Maybe I'll bump into the ghost of old man Brown or whoever they named the school after."
"03","22","0","RYAN","Seth, you know Summer's going to be there."
"03","22","0","SETH","I don't know that for sure."
"03","22","0","RYAN","Every student at Harbor is going to their college this weekend. I'm sure she's going to be there."
"03","22","0","SETH","So, it's not like we'll run into each other. We're going to a land of pasty Jewish kids. For once, I'll blend right in."
"03","22","0","RYAN","Yeah? And your flight?"
"03","22","0","SETH","Booked a ticket connecting through Chattanooga. Totally inconvenient, no way she'll be on it."
"03","22","0","RYAN","Look, I just don't want to see you get deeper into this mess, okay?"
"03","22","0","SETH","Dude, you're going to Berkeley with your ex-girlfriend."
"03","22","0","KIRSTEN","You ready to go? College calls."
"03","22","0","RYAN","Uh, yeah. Think we're all set."
"03","22","0","KIRSTEN","Just think... the next time we send you two off like this, it'll be for real."
"03","22","0","RYAN","I'll only be a few hours away."
"03","22","0","KIRSTEN","What about you, going all the way to the East Coast? If I wasn't so proud of you, I'd be angry at you for..."
"03","22","0","SETH","All right, all right, we got planes to catch."
"03","22","0","KIRSTEN","Okay, let's go."
"03","22","0","RYAN","Where's Sandy?"
"03","22","0","KIRSTEN","Uh, he had an early meeting. He said to say good-bye."
"03","22","0","SETH","That's weird, the man lives for the airport sendoff."
"03","22","0","KIRSTEN","Well, I guess it was an important meeting."
"03","22","1","SETH","All right, well, my gate's this way."
"03","22","1","KIRSTEN","Call when you get there."
"03","22","1","SETH","Yeah. All right, bring it in. We can save the hug for later."
"03","22","1","RYAN","Yeah, okay."
"03","22","1","SETH","See you Sunday."
"03","22","1","RYAN","Okay."
"03","22","1","KIRSTEN","And what about you? Are you okay?"
"03","22","1","RYAN","Uh, I'm a little nervous actually."
"03","22","1","KIRSTEN","Ryan, Berkeley's going to be a breeze. I mean, you conquered Newport, and this town isn't exactly known for its hospitality."
"03","22","1","RYAN","Yeah, but I had you and I had Seth and Sandy."
"03","22","1","KIRSTEN","Hey, you did this. You earned your future. Enjoy it."
"03","22","1","RYAN","All right, thanks."
"03","22","1","KIRSTEN","Have a wonderful time and call when you get there."
"03","22","1","RYAN","Okay, I will."
"03","22","2","THERESA","Hey."
"03","22","2","THERESA","Here you go."
"03","22","2","THERESA","Can I borrow that sparkly scarf?"
"03","22","3","SUMMER","What am I thinking? Kids at Brown don't wear sparkly scarves. Maybe on my way to the airport, I'll stop and get some kind of angry looking piercing."
"03","22","3","MARISSA","Sum, you should just dress like yourself."
"03","22","3","SUMMER","This is all wrong."
"03","22","3","MARISSA","What, the scarf?"
"03","22","3","SUMMER","No, this, all of this. Me going to Brown without Cohen. You going to Berkeley without Ryan."
"03","22","3","MARISSA","I'm going to Berkeley with Ryan, I'm just not going with him."
"03","22","3","SUMMER","Yeah, which is even weirder."
"03","22","3","MARISSA","Well, maybe it's a blessing in disguise. You know, this way we're forced to focus on the future. And we can start doing that this weekend."
"03","22","3","SUMMER","Hmm, big talk coming from the girl who chucked her acceptance letter in the garbage."
"03","22","3","MARISSA","Yeah, well, I was going through something."
"03","22","3","SUMMER","Is ""something"" code for having an affair with an almost homeless surfer dude? And does your past tense imply it's over?"
"03","22","3","MARISSA","Look, whatever I was doing with Volchok..."
"03","22","3","SUMMER","I don't need details."
"03","22","3","MARISSA","I'm not doing it anymore. In fact, after today, I probably won't ever see him again."
"03","22","3","SUMMER","What do you mean after today?"
"03","22","3","MARISSA","Well, he texted me to say I left some stuff at his place, and I told him I would stop by and pick it up before I left."
"03","22","3","SUMMER","Hmm, no, you won't. Saying your last good-bye with his dirty mattress in plain sight? That is breakup s*x waiting to happen."
"03","22","3","MARISSA","Have you no faith in me at all?"
"03","22","3","SUMMER","48 hours ago, Coop, you were Newport's Courtney Love. Baby steps."
"03","22","3","MARISSA","Fine. I'll just tell him to meet me at the diner. You know what? You should take this with you to Brown. They're going to love you, just so long as you be yourself."
"03","22","3","SUMMER","Talk about clichéd advice. I can say things like that, now that I'm smart."
"03","22","4","SUMMER","Hey."
"03","22","4","MARISSA","Hey."
"03","22","4","SUMMER","Oh, no, we got it. But we could use your muscle to help get our bags in the trunk."
"03","22","4","JULIE","Marissa, honey, you know, it's not too late for me to go with you. I promise, I wouldn't embarrass you. I could pretend to be part of your entourage, or your Scientology guide."
"03","22","4","MARISSA","Mom, you don't have to worry, okay?"
"03","22","4","JULIE","Kids go crazy at college. You've seen Girls Gone Wild."
"03","22","4","MARISSA","Yeah, I lived it. Not the topless part. But don't worry, I've got all that partying out of my system. I really do want something different from this."
"03","22","4","JULIE","Well, the Cooper women do have nine lives. I'm just glad you're on to your next one."
"03","22","4","MARISSA","Bye. I'll see you guys in a few days. Bye, Mom."
"03","22","4","JULIE","Have fun. Okay, did a priest just break in here and perform an exorcism?"
"03","22","4","JULIE","Well, it's just you and me this weekend. What should we do? I could call the Montage."
"03","22","4","JULIE","Oh, right, well, then, thank God for Netflix."
"03","22","4","JULIE","Why? So the women can gossip about me after I leave?"
"03","22","4","JULIE","Well, I have Kirsten then. She's my wing woman."
"03","22","4","JULIE","Then I'm there."
"03","22","5","RYAN","Oh, hey."
"03","22","5","RYAN","No, no worries."
"03","22","5","RYAN","Yeah, nice to meet you."
"03","22","5","RYAN","No, no, I'm good."
"03","22","5","RYAN","Okay."
"03","22","5","RYAN","No, sounds good."
"03","22","5","RYAN","Uh, yeah, you know it?"
"03","22","5","RYAN","Uh, no, no. You know what? Actually, I'm not really from Newport. I mean, I am, but up until the last two years, I was, uh, I was living in Chino. Uh, I guess I figured I needed to get that out of the way."
"03","22","5","RYAN","What do you mean?"
"03","22","5","RYAN","Ah, I guess I'm not really used to that."
"03","22","6","MARISSA","Hey. Summer's waiting and I've got a plane to catch. So do you have my stuff?"
"03","22","6","MARISSA","What? Why?"
"03","22","6","MARISSA","I really never thought of you as the possessive type."
"03","22","6","MARISSA","It's what you already know. You and me, we have nothing in common."
"03","22","6","MARISSA","No, it's not like that. You really want to know? When I was little, my sister and I used to always watch The Sound of Music."
"03","22","6","MARISSA","Okay, well, there's this girl in it, Liesl, and I always used to think I was going to grow up to be just like her. You know, I'd have the really cute boyfriend, that looked like her boyfriend. And our lives would be just like the scene where they're... they're standing in the gazebo and singing to each other. Then I grew up, and... and I found myself doing coke and sleeping with a guy who I'd never had one real conversation with. I know it sounds cheesy, but I'm just not ready to give up on the Sound of Music thing. Not yet."
"03","22","7","SANDY","No, it's not going to be a problem, I promise you. Look... Hey, hey, hey. Let me get back to you, all right? I was just about to get some lunch. You want to go out?"
"03","22","7","KIRSTEN","Uh, I only have a minute."
"03","22","7","SANDY","I am so sorry about the other night. I tried to call you."
"03","22","7","KIRSTEN","I came about something else. When I was at the airport this morning, I saw Ryan's ex-girlfriend Theresa."
"03","22","7","SANDY","How's she doing?"
"03","22","7","KIRSTEN","She had a baby with her, a boy, looked about two."
"03","22","7","SANDY","You think it might be Ryan's?"
"03","22","7","KIRSTEN","I think it's possible."
"03","22","7","SANDY","You spoke to her?"
"03","22","7","KIRSTEN","No."
"03","22","7","SANDY","Well, then for all you know, he could be her cousin or her nephew."
"03","22","7","KIRSTEN","I saw the way she was with him, the way she picked him up-- she's a mother."
"03","22","7","SANDY","Yeah, well, she told Ryan that she lost their baby, so... what are you saying, she lied?"
"03","22","7","KIRSTEN","I just think we should tell him what I saw. We've always been honest with him, that's why he trusts us."
"03","22","7","SANDY","Oh, honey, let's keep it to ourselves. At least until he gets back."
"03","22","8","RYAN","Hey, Seth."
"03","22","8","SETH","Hey, man, how's Berkeley?"
"03","22","8","RYAN","It's cold and wet and pretty cool. I can't believe I'm actually on a college campus."
"03","22","8","SETH","Ryan, I am touching ivy right now."
"03","22","8","RYAN","What?"
"03","22","8","SETH","Real ivy. It grows on the buildings here. Those pictures in the brochure-- they are not Photoshopped."
"03","22","8","RYAN","Ah! I take it you're in the middle of the quad right now?"
"03","22","8","SETH","Yeah. Dead center."
"03","22","8","RYAN","Pretty stuff. I can't imagine anyone actually seeing you there."
"03","22","8","SETH","I know, I know. It's a Summer haunt, but I had to come visit campus for a few minutes."
"03","22","8","RYAN","And it's perfect?"
"03","22","8","SETH","Man, it's better than perfect. Seth Cohen has come home to roost."
"03","22","8","ANNA","Cohen?"
"03","22","8","RYAN","Who's that?"
"03","22","8","SETH","I don't know. I'm too afraid to turn around. Anna?"
"03","22","9","SETH","So... Newport v. Pittsburgh. Who would win in a Smackdown?"
"03","22","9","ANNA","For me, Pittsburgh."
"03","22","9","SETH","Come on. You miss Newport. The sun and the surf. The surgery."
"03","22","9","ANNA","They have not perfected the chin implant in Pittsburgh, but I am optimistic."
"03","22","9","SETH","Mocking Newport with Anna Stern. That is one of my favorite pastimes."
"03","22","9","ANNA","Mine, too. But I did get a small taste when Atomic County came out."
"03","22","9","SETH","Hey, you saw my comic?"
"03","22","9","ANNA","I was so proud of you."
"03","22","9","SETH","Thanks."
"03","22","9","ANNA","But I do have a few notes on my character Punky Spitfire."
"03","22","9","SETH","Okay."
"03","22","9","ANNA","And that mobisode was hilarious."
"03","22","9","SETH","What the hell is a mobisode?"
"03","22","9","ANNA","You don't know? I thought it was your comic."
"03","22","9","SETH","Oh. Yeah, it was, but I traded it to a guy named Zach Stevens in exchange for Summer."
"03","22","9","ANNA","How romantic. How are you guys?"
"03","22","9","SETH","Great. Uh... yeah, great."
"03","22","9","SETH","Great."
"03","22","9","ANNA","Great. Tell her I say hi."
"03","22","9","SETH","I will. I wouldn't want her to get the wrong idea about us bumping into each other out here."
"03","22","9","ANNA","I know, it does kind of seem like fate."
"03","22","9","SETH","Yeah. Not exactly."
"03","22","9","ANNA","Oh, ouch."
"03","22","9","SETH","No. What I mean is-- and, um, the only other person who knows this is Ryan, so... I am not officially admitted here."
"03","22","9","ANNA","You didn't get in?!"
"03","22","9","SETH","Shut up. No, I didn't. That's why I'm out here this weekend; I'm trying to get in."
"03","22","9","ANNA","And how do you plan on doing that?"
"03","22","9","SETH","I haven't quite nailed that down yet, but now that I've run into you, who, if I remember correctly, is not only sage but wise."
"03","22","9","ANNA","And you want me to come up with some hair-brained scheme to, what, smuggle you into college?"
"03","22","9","SETH","Yes, please. For me? Listen, it's fate. You said it yourself."
"03","22","9","ANNA","All right. There's a Meet the Faculty reception here tonight. I assume Dr. Overbee will be there."
"03","22","9","SETH","That's the admissions dude."
"03","22","9","ANNA","You can try talking to him."
"03","22","9","SETH","And I will say what?"
"03","22","9","ANNA","You're the one who flew all the way out here, because you want to go here so badly. Don't you think that you should come up with that speech yourself?"
"03","22","10","JULIE","What are you doing tomorrow night? No plans? Good. You're going to Neil's dinner with all the doctors. Sandy can do some recruiting for the new hospital. You and I can sit in the corner and gossip. A fun time will be had by all."
"03","22","10","KIRSTEN","Actually, I'm busy."
"03","22","10","JULIE","Kiki... All you ever do is sit in this house and drink tea. I mean, what's the real reason?"
"03","22","10","KIRSTEN","Sandy and I have hit a bit of a rough patch."
"03","22","10","JULIE","Oh. What happened?"
"03","22","10","KIRSTEN","It's complicated. Suffice it to say, I'm not a huge fan of this hospital project."
"03","22","10","JULIE","Well, are you a huge fan of me? 'Cause, you know, I'm just saying, if you need a reason to go, you're looking at one."
"03","22","10","KIRSTEN","You don't need me to do this."
"03","22","10","JULIE","Yeah, Kirsten, I do. You know, ever since Caleb died, the only way I've been able to navigate through these Newpsie-infested waters is with you by my side. Please, Kirsten. I want Dr. Roberts' doctor friends to like me."
"03","22","10","KIRSTEN","Fine. But I'm only doing this for you."
"03","22","10","JULIE","Thank you. I owe you one. Or, you know, maybe it's more than one. But who's counting? Okay, see you tomorrow."
"03","22","11","RYAN","Yeah, yeah."
"03","22","11","RYAN","You win."
"03","22","11","RYAN","Really? Let me ask you, ever feel out of place here?"
"03","22","11","RYAN","No, that's amazing."
"03","22","11","MARISSA","Hi."
"03","22","11","RYAN","Hi."
"03","22","11","MARISSA","We were in the same class."
"03","22","11","RYAN","Yeah, at Harbor. Uh, this is Miguel."
"03","22","11","MARISSA","Hi."
"03","22","11","RYAN","And Wes, my freshman buddy."
"03","22","11","MARISSA","Oh, mine is a vegan, and she's boycotting this, 'cause of the turkey on your plate."
"03","22","11","MARISSA","Yeah, but I'm fine, no worries. See you guys around."
"03","22","11","RYAN","Yeah, yeah, we dated, on and off for two and a half years. That'll do it."
"03","22","11","RYAN","Well, listen, if you want to go talk to her..."
"03","22","11","RYAN","No, honestly. I'm gonna be in college with her, so I've got to get used to it. Really, go for it."
"03","22","11","RYAN","No."
"03","22","12","ANNA","Okay, look, there he is-- Dr. Overbee, Head of Admissions. What? What?"
"03","22","12","SETH","Nothing, I'm just looking around."
"03","22","12","ANNA","Why are you acting like a fugitive?"
"03","22","12","SETH","Uh, no, no, I'm just trying to stay under the radar. You never know who's gonna be at these things."
"03","22","12","ANNA","Well, focus. Have you thought about what you're gonna say to him?"
"03","22","12","SETH","Uh, probably just gonna riff. You know? Uh, we're both dudes. I mean, even though he's got a bow tie and probably like nine Ph.D.s, underneath, I'm sure we're pretty much the same."
"03","22","12","ANNA","Could you maybe think of some talking points?"
"03","22","12","SETH","Okay, shh. He's by himself. This is my moment."
"03","22","13","SETH","Dr. Overbee."
"03","22","14","SUMMER","You guys, what is a jihad?"
"03","22","15","SETH","Seth Cohen. You may remember me from my application essay on Superman. Lonely guy, Superman."
"03","22","15","SETH","Yeah, about that. Do you have a minute? You maybe want to take a walk, stretch your legs?"
"03","22","15","SETH","Dr. Overbee, please. I really need to talk to you. If you can't do it now, name the time and place. All I need is five minutes."
"03","22","15","SETH","Great, thank you so much. Thank you so much."
"03","22","15","SUMMER","Cohen?"
"03","22","15","SETH","Oh, hey. What's going on?"
"03","22","15","SUMMER","What the hell are you doing here?"
"03","22","15","SETH","Ah... Providence in spring, can't beat it."
"03","22","15","SUMMER","So you are going to Brown. You just didn't want to come with me."
"03","22","15","ANNA","How'd it go?"
"03","22","15","SUMMER","Anna."
"03","22","15","ANNA","Summer."
"03","22","15","SETH","You're probably really confused right about now."
"03","22","15","SUMMER","No, not at all. All of this, everything you've done up until now, finally makes sense."
"03","22","16","MARISSA","Couple years. But we've both been with other people since then. It's not exactly normal yet, but we're working on it. So where is Ryan anyway?"
"03","22","16","MARISSA","Where do you hang out?"
"03","22","16","MARISSA","My dad was a poly-sci major. No, you kind of remind me of him a little bit. The good parts, at least."
"03","22","16","MARISSA","It is. One second."
"03","22","16","RYAN","Hey."
"03","22","16","MARISSA","Hi."
"03","22","16","RYAN","I didn't know you were gonna be here."
"03","22","16","MARISSA","Yeah, I hope it's not weird that I am. I don't really know what the rules are between us."
"03","22","16","RYAN","Oh, me either."
"03","22","16","MARISSA","So I know the whole friendship thing didn't really work out in Newport, but..."
"03","22","16","RYAN","That was Newport, you know? Everything feels different here. I'm willing to try."
"03","22","16","MARISSA","Hmm. Well, I don't know. You know, 'cause if I was in your circle of friends, I might accidentally let it slip that you used to do musicals."
"03","22","16","RYAN","I have enough dirt on you to last the next four years, so bring it on."
"03","22","16","MARISSA","That might be true. Anyway, you want to come sit with me and Wes? I want to hear about your architecture tour."
"03","22","16","RYAN","Really?"
"03","22","16","MARISSA","Yeah."
"03","22","17","ANNA","Seth, it's okay."
"03","22","17","SETH","I'm sorry, I should have told you I was on a Summer mission."
"03","22","17","ANNA","Yeah, well, I should have known it. But I can't be mad at you when you're this pathetic."
"03","22","17","SETH","Thank you."
"03","22","17","ANNA","Now stop wallowing, and let's figure out how we're gonna get you out of this."
"03","22","17","SETH","Why do you want to help me?"
"03","22","17","ANNA","It's the pathetic thing. It really works on me. Okay, look, here's a list of tomorrow's pre-frosh activities. Try and figure out which ones Summer might go to."
"03","22","17","SETH","I don't know. She's never been much of a joiner. Maybe the walking tour; she likes cardio."
"03","22","17","ANNA","Oh, good, you can go to that, you can talk to her. But now we've got to figure out what you're gonna say to Dr. Overbee."
"03","22","17","SETH","I don't know. If he didn't like my Superman essay, I'm out."
"03","22","17","ANNA","Seth, you flew all this way to win her back. Now have you five minutes with Dr. Overbee to make it happen. We're gonna write the speech."
"03","22","17","SETH","What have I done the last two years without you?"
"03","22","17","ANNA","Honestly... I don't know."
"03","22","18","SANDY","Hey. I got your message about the hospital dinner."
"03","22","18","KIRSTEN","Tomorrow night. Can you make it?"
"03","22","18","SANDY","Absolutely. Maybe I can get some of these doctors excited about the new hospital. Hey! Ryan! How are my old stomping grounds? I'm happy to hear that. Hey, listen, you know what? I got a call that I got to take here. It's work. I'm going to hand you off to Kirsten, all right? Have fun. Hello."
"03","22","18","KIRSTEN","Hey, how's it going?"
"03","22","18","RYAN","Hey, Kirsten, it's, um, it's actually kind of amazing. How are you?"
"03","22","18","KIRSTEN","Fine. I'm good, fine."
"03","22","18","RYAN","You don't sound fine."
"03","22","18","KIRSTEN","Don't be silly. Tell me more about college."
"03","22","18","RYAN","Kirsten, what's going on?"
"03","22","18","KIRSTEN","It can wait till you get home."
"03","22","18","RYAN","Okay, so there is something."
"03","22","18","KIRSTEN","It's really... it-it's not... it's not important."
"03","22","18","RYAN","Then you won't mind telling me what is it."
"03","22","18","KIRSTEN","I-I don't want you to overreact because that's probably what I am doing. I saw Theresa at the airport. She had a baby with her. It looked like her son."
"03","22","18","RYAN","An-And you think?"
"03","22","18","KIRSTEN","I don't know what I think."
"03","22","19","ANNA","There she is. Now, remember, you're just gonna tell her the truth."
"03","22","19","SETH","Right."
"03","22","19","ANNA","Yes."
"03","22","19","SETH","Okay, all of it."
"03","22","20","SETH","Summer, can I talk to you?"
"03","22","20","SUMMER","Just leave me alone, Cohen."
"03","22","20","SETH","Look, I want to explain to you about everything."
"03","22","20","SETH","Uh... yeah. Yeah, I do. I'm all set."
"03","22","20","SETH","Yes. Kumar Zimmerman. I'm half Indian, I am half Jewish. I am a Hin-Jew."
"03","22","20","SETH","Ever since we got our acceptance letters, I've been acting like a freak, I know that."
"03","22","20","SUMMER","Does this tour offer an audio option? You know, like when you get headsets at the museum?"
"03","22","20","SETH","Summer, you can't just ignore me forever."
"03","22","20","SUMMER","Oh, yes, I can. Don't you remember middle school? I was really good at ignoring you. Now, I'm just getting back into shape."
"03","22","20","SETH","Look, I promise you, I did not know Anna was going to be here."
"03","22","20","SETH","Yeah, sorry. You're probably wondering about the Kumar thing. Uh, again, if you let me explain, I promise you it will all make sense."
"03","22","20","SUMMER","Oh, no. It already makes sense, okay? I don't need any explanation. You broke up with me 'cause you wanted to be free to date smart women in college. You got quite the head start."
"03","22","20","SETH","Summer, that is so not it."
"03","22","20","SUMMER","Look, you already ruined senior year for me. There's nothing I can do about that now. I'm not going to let you ruin college, too. Now will you please just leave me alone? Please!"
"03","22","21","RYAN","Hi."
"03","22","21","KIRSTEN","Ryan."
"03","22","21","RYAN","I couldn't stay."
"03","22","21","KIRSTEN","I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told you."
"03","22","21","RYAN","No, no. I'm glad you did. It's funny. In a way, I was kind of expecting it. I mean, for once things were uncomplicated. How long could that last, right?"
"03","22","21","KIRSTEN","Well, maybe it's not."
"03","22","21","RYAN","Yeah, yeah, I know."
"03","22","21","KIRSTEN","Whatever is going on with Theresa, we'll get to the bottom of it. I did some research on the Internet, and I found her address."
"03","22","21","RYAN","Oh, great, thanks. I'm going to put this in the pool house."
"03","22","21","KIRSTEN","Ryan, no matter what happens, we're behind you."
"03","22","22","SETH","Dr. Overbee, you made it."
"03","22","22","SETH","Sure, sure, okay. You're a busy guy, and I have a tendency to ramble, which is why I've prepared this statement. Dr. Overbee, the following is a list of reasons why I should have gotten into Brown."
"03","22","22","SETH","No, I didn't, but only because I'm sure there was some sort of clerical error, or maybe a human error. Maybe the computer froze."
"03","22","22","SETH","I know. But will you please just listen to me, and if you still don't want to let me in, at least I'll know I tried?"
"03","22","22","SETH","Then I'm going to have to sort of, uh, condense this, maybe make it more of a bullet point thing. Grades-- 3.8. Hmm? Uh, SATs-- 2250. That's not perfect, but I would say it's respectable. I was President of the Comic Book Club. I was also a member of the chess team, although I was extremely low-profile about it."
"03","22","22","SETH","Okay. Now, here's the part about how I belong on the East Coast, and... This is a little joke about the weather here, just to keep it light. It's pretty funny. And, uh... I guess that's about it."
"03","22","22","SETH","Dr. Overbee, I have to get in here. Okay? And it's not just because I love it, although I do, I truly... I do. It's because of a girl. Her name is Summer Roberts, and she's going here, and if I don't get in, I'm going to lose her, and the rest of my life is going to be ruined."
"03","22","22","SETH","Yes. It's about the girl. Do you get it?"
"03","22","22","SETH","Please?"
"03","22","23","SANDY","Ryan, I thought you weren't getting home until tomorrow."
"03","22","23","RYAN","Uh, Kirsten didn't tell you?"
"03","22","23","SANDY","No, no, she didn't."
"03","22","23","RYAN","Yeah, I kind of figured I needed to get home and deal with this."
"03","22","23","SANDY","Right, right, of course."
"03","22","23","RYAN","You know, in case it turns out to be..."
"03","22","23","SANDY","We'll cross that bridge if and when we come to it."
"03","22","23","RYAN","Yeah, yeah. Okay."
"03","22","23","SANDY","All right."
"03","22","24","SANDY","You told him."
"03","22","24","KIRSTEN","I didn't think he'd come home."
"03","22","24","SANDY","Well, you know Ryan better than that."
"03","22","24","KIRSTEN","It just happened, you weren't there, you had to take a business call."
"03","22","24","SANDY","Oh, so you told Ryan about Theresa to punish me?"
"03","22","24","KIRSTEN","I told him because he asked, because he has a right to know."
"03","22","24","SANDY","Theresa hasn't demanded anything of him, why should we?"
"03","22","24","KIRSTEN","Being a father is important. Being a family is important. There was a time when you'd be making this argument."
"03","22","24","SANDY","What's that supposed to mean?"
"03","22","24","KIRSTEN","You know what I'm talking about."
"03","22","24","SANDY","I know that we have to talk about this some more, and I can't right now. I got to go back to the office before dinner."
"03","22","24","KIRSTEN","It'll have to wait, fine."
"03","22","25","MARISSA","Oh, hey."
"03","22","25","MARISSA","Here, let me help you."
"03","22","25","MARISSA","Yeah. Here."
"03","22","25","MARISSA","Oh, well, I was supposed to go to a freshman barbecue, but considering the rain, I could be persuaded otherwise."
"03","22","25","MARISSA","Hey, where's Ryan?"
"03","22","25","MARISSA","He went home?"
"03","22","25","MARISSA","Well, I should call him. Or shouldn't I? I don't know. Should I give him space?"
"03","22","25","MARISSA","I guess so."
"03","22","25","MARISSA","Is that a hint?"
"03","22","25","MARISSA","Okay, here."
"03","22","26","RYAN","Hi. I'm looking for Theresa. Is she home?"
"03","22","26","RYAN","I'm... Ryan Atwood. I'm an old friend."
"03","22","26","RYAN","Hi, Daniel. This is Theresa's kid, huh?"
"03","22","26","RYAN","Okay."
"03","22","27","MARISSA","Yeah. It seems like everyone is."
"03","22","27","MARISSA","That's got to be tough."
"03","22","27","MARISSA","You? Please. You're like the model freshman."
"03","22","27","MARISSA","Why, what happened?"
"03","22","27","MARISSA","I never would have guessed."
"03","22","27","MARISSA","You bought that?"
"03","22","27","MARISSA","Well, it wouldn't have been two years ago. I was the girl on yearbook, charity league, social chair-- whatever my mom told me to do. I got straight As... sometimes a ""B"" in math, but my dad was a whiz, so he'd help me. And then on the weekends, I rode my little sister's pony for fun. I even won some blue ribbons."
"03","22","27","MARISSA","Well, my dad lost all his money... the pony lost all its hair, and my mom kind of lost her mind. Also, I got kicked out of school, and my friend died. I guess everything happened. And then at some point, I just... stopped being the girl who belonged at college... or anywhere, for that matter."
"03","22","27","MARISSA","Maybe not everyone. Maybe some people just get lost."
"03","22","28","RYAN","I won't know anything till I talk to Theresa. I'm just... just going to have to wait."
"03","22","28","SETH","Yeah, well, not to worry. I'm on the next flight home. I'm just waiting on my cab."
"03","22","28","RYAN","Seth, you don't have to come home early on my account."
"03","22","28","SETH","Oh, there are a lot of reasons, trust me. See you when I get home."
"03","22","29","ANNA","Get in."
"03","22","29","SETH","Hey."
"03","22","29","ANNA","Hey."
"03","22","29","SETH","Are you giving me a ride to the airport?"
"03","22","29","ANNA","Eventually."
"03","22","29","SETH","My plane leaves in, like, an hour or so."
"03","22","29","ANNA","Well, that is just enough time to make a quick stop at RISD."
"03","22","29","SETH","You mean the Rhode Island School of Design?"
"03","22","29","ANNA","You're going to apply, and this is your application."
"03","22","29","SETH","Where'd you get this?"
"03","22","29","SETH","Anna..."
"03","22","29","ANNA","Hmm? If you get in, you'll be in the same state as Summer, and the good news is, it is a very small state."
"03","22","29","SETH","I know, I know, but that's, like, one of the best art schools in the country, and as much as I love the face-to-face college rejection, I think I should just cut my losses on this one."
"03","22","29","ANNA","Cohen."
"03","22","29","SETH","Yeah?"
"03","22","29","ANNA","Confidence, remember?"
"03","22","29","SETH","Right."
"03","22","29","ANNA","Good. All right, we're going to RISD."
"03","22","30","JULIE","Kiki, you made it."
"03","22","30","SANDY","It's good to see you, Neil."
"03","22","30","SANDY","Hey, Julie."
"03","22","30","JULIE","Hey."
"03","22","30","KIRSTEN","Thank you."
"03","22","30","SANDY","That'd be great. Excuse me."
"03","22","30","JULIE","Uh-oh, what's wrong?"
"03","22","30","KIRSTEN","Long story."
"03","22","30","JULIE","Oh... and now you have to watch him work the crowd all night, and it's because of me."
"03","22","30","KIRSTEN","No, Julie, it's okay. I wouldn't have bailed on you."
"03","22","30","JULIE","Okay, well, then let me return the favor. Come on, let's go hide out by the crab dip. Maybe we could flirt with one of the bartenders."
"03","22","31","MARISSA","Hi."
"03","22","31","RYAN","Hey."
"03","22","31","MARISSA","I just wanted to see if you were okay."
"03","22","31","RYAN","Yeah. You, uh... you bailed early, too, huh?"
"03","22","31","MARISSA","Yeah."
"03","22","31","RYAN","Come in. So Berkeley didn't live up to the hype?"
"03","22","31","MARISSA","Yeah, well, it's not really Berkeley's fault. I was sort of asking a lot of it."
"03","22","31","RYAN","To take you away from every problem you've ever had here?"
"03","22","31","MARISSA","Something like that. So, you don't have to tell me, but..."
"03","22","31","RYAN","Oh, it's Theresa. She did have a baby."
"03","22","31","MARISSA","Oh, my God."
"03","22","31","RYAN","I haven't talked to her yet, so I'm not sure... if I'm the father or not."
"03","22","31","MARISSA","Well, what makes you think you're the father and not Eddie?"
"03","22","31","RYAN","Uh, because when I was at Berkeley, I... I just felt like I was living somebody else's life, and, um, then I heard the news, and... I don't know. It's like, boom, back to being me."
"03","22","31","MARISSA","But when you were at Berkeley, it felt right, didn't it? I could see it on your face."
"03","22","31","RYAN","Yeah, yeah, it did."
"03","22","31","MARISSA","Well, then you'll get back there... no matter what happens with Theresa."
"03","22","32","SANDY","Hello, everyone. As the new guy in these circles, I'd like to thank Neil and Julie for inviting us here tonight, and I'd like to welcome you all to lend your talent and expertise to the new hospital, because I am going to need all the help I can get. As you know, behind every successful man is a very surprised woman. I'd like you to meet the former head of the Newport Group and really the brains behind the organization, my lovely wife, Kirsten Cohen."
"03","22","32","KIRSTEN","I'd like to propose a toast. To Sandy Cohen...who has told me countless times over the last year how important this hospital is to him."
"03","22","32","JULIE","Ouch."
"03","22","32","KIRSTEN","You know, they say that when you grow up, you marry your father. I thought I'd escaped that."
"03","22","33","MARISSA","Seth is going to Brown, and he's dating Anna?"
"03","22","33","SUMMER","I know! Is your brain exploding?"
"03","22","33","MARISSA","A little. How did he explain himself?"
"03","22","33","SUMMER","He didn't. Okay, well, he tried to, but you know how I get, Coop. The rage makes it hard to talk, let alone listen."
"03","22","33","MARISSA","Well, I mean, don't assume anything until you hear what he has to say. You don't know for sure they're dating."
"03","22","33","SUMMER","So how was Berkeley? Was it amazing?"
"03","22","33","MARISSA","Yeah. I mean, it could be... if I was ready for it. I just don't know that I am."
"03","22","33","SUMMER","Well, I believe in you, Coop. I'll see you in eight short hours, okay?"
"03","22","33","MARISSA","Okay. Bye."
"03","22","34","ANNA","I am beyond happy for you right now. I'm like, uh, Christmas-morning, won-the-lottery level happy for you."
"03","22","34","SETH","Well, the RISD guy only said he was impressed."
"03","22","34","ANNA","Mm-mm, he said very impressed, and in scenarios like these, verys are important."
"03","22","34","SETH","Well, if I get in, it's all 'cause of you."
"03","22","34","ANNA","No. It's your comic book. And your plane's about to leave."
"03","22","34","SETH","Well, thank you, really. All right."
"03","22","34","ANNA","Okay. See you soon. Call me."
"03","22","34","SETH","Will do."
"03","22","35","THERESA","Ryan."
"03","22","35","RYAN","Hi."
"03","22","35","THERESA","I don't know how you found me."
"03","22","35","RYAN","Uh, look, I just need to know."
"03","22","35","THERESA","He's not yours, Ryan. Eddie's the father. We got a paternity test and everything. I'm sorry that I wasn't honest with you, but I saw how your life opened up when you met the Cohens, and I..."
"03","22","35","RYAN","Is Eddie helping you out?"
"03","22","35","THERESA","Are you kidding? That bum."
"03","22","35","RYAN","I would've, you know, for what it's worth."
"03","22","35","THERESA","I know that."
"03","22","35","RYAN","Even if it hadn't have been mine."
"03","22","35","THERESA","I know, that's why I didn't tell you. But believe it or not, I'm doing okay on my own."
"03","22","35","RYAN","Yeah, seems like it."
"03","22","35","THERESA","Yeah."
"03","22","35","RYAN","I saw the apartment."
"03","22","35","THERESA","Yeah."
"03","22","35","RYAN","How is he?"
"03","22","35","THERESA","How much time do you have?"
"03","22","35","RYAN","I don't know. You want to go grab a bite and tell me about him?"
"03","22","35","THERESA","Yeah, I'd like that."
"03","22","35","RYAN","Yeah?"
"03","22","35","THERESA","Yeah. It's good to see you again, Ryan."
"03","22","35","RYAN","Yeah, it's good to see you."
"03","23","0","SETH","It's senior prom; it's mythic."
"03","23","0","RYAN","Yeah, well, it's ties and dresses and photos with parents. Sounds like any other dance to me."
"03","23","0","SETH","Well, it's not. It's a romantic capstone to your entire adolescence, and if Summer and I don't go together, it's over."
"03","23","0","RYAN","Well, ask her."
"03","23","0","SETH","Oh, she's still not talking to me."
"03","23","0","RYAN","Well, have you told her there's nothing going on between you and Anna?"
"03","23","0","SETH","I tried, but every time we get close, she blows her rape whistle."
"03","23","0","RYAN","Rape. Well, you know, I'm not going, so, if you, uh... if you want to hang out, rent a movie..."
"03","23","0","SETH","Ryan, I love you, but if I have to spend my senior prom playing video games with you, I'm going to kill myself. Besides, I left Summer a message telling her I'm going to meet her at the diner tomorrow morning."
"03","23","0","RYAN","You think she'll show?"
"03","23","0","SETH","Kind of pretended I was the Brown admissions guy. It's senior prom; anything goes. Hi, there."
"03","23","0","SETH","Chicken, please."
"03","23","0","RYAN","And I'll have the beef."
"03","23","0","SETH","Why aren't you going to ask someone, man? What about Tina Woo-- she's been looking really hot lately. What about Theresa?"
"03","23","0","RYAN","Uh, yeah, I don't think so."
"03","23","0","SETH","Why? You said you've been spending a lot of time with her."
"03","23","0","RYAN","We have. Actually, she's coming over to the house tomorrow."
"03","23","0","SETH","Okay, great-- now that the baby thing's resolved, the pressure's off. It's perfect. Do it."
"03","23","0","RYAN","But, I mean, she still has the baby. She can't just, you know..."
"03","23","0","SETH","One night. They have these new crazy things called baby-sitters. I'm just saying, it's senior prom. She's your childhood sweetheart. You have to respect the romantic symmetry."
"03","23","0","RYAN","You know what? I'll think about it and I appreciate you not bringing up the idea of Marissa and I going as friends."
"03","23","0","SETH","No, I get it. It's in the past."
"03","23","0","RYAN","Plus, I assume she'll be going with the surf nazi anyways, unless he's selling crack to blind kids, or..."
"03","23","0","SETH","or fondling some girl at the end of the pier. Ah, maybe that's his cousin. His really... dirty cousin."
"03","23","1","SUMMER","Hi. Leave."
"03","23","1","SETH","Okay, Summer..."
"03","23","1","SUMMER","No, I'm meeting someone here. You need to leave."
"03","23","1","SETH","The Brown guy?"
"03","23","1","SUMMER","How did you know that?"
"03","23","1","SETH","I'm sorry. It was just the only way I could get you to meet me."
"03","23","1","SUMMER","You are sick, you know that? Deranged."
"03","23","2","THERESA","No."
"03","23","2","RYAN","Yes."
"03","23","2","THERESA","No."
"03","23","2","RYAN","Yes."
"03","23","2","THERESA","No, our first kiss was on Halloween. Trust me, it was my sixth birthday, and my mom let me have dancing, but you didn't know how, so you hid in the bathroom."
"03","23","2","RYAN","And you tracked me down and kissed me. How did I ever block that out?"
"03","23","2","THERESA","I don't know."
"03","23","2","RYAN","This is crazy. Do you want to go to prom with me?"
"03","23","2","THERESA","What?"
"03","23","3","MARISSA","Okay... Wait, that's not why I'm here. So, you're going to think I'm... really lame, but... would you maybe want to go to prom with me?"
"03","23","4","SETH","Just give me two minutes. I ordered pancakes for you-- chocolate chip."
"03","23","4","SUMMER","Fine, two minutes, but that is it."
"03","23","4","SETH","Okay."
"03","23","4","SUMMER","Hey, somebody wrote ""prom"" on my pancake. That is so weird."
"03","23","4","SETH","Weird!"
"03","23","4","SUMMER","Oh, my God."
"03","23","5","RYAN","Yeah, it's tomorrow night, so it's kind of late notice, but, um... Or not, or not. You know what? It's-it's probably a bad idea."
"03","23","5","THERESA","No, Ryan, it's just that... there's this guy that I work with, and we're not really dating or anything, but we've become close."
"03","23","5","RYAN","Yeah, no, I understand. Uh, I should probably get ready for school."
"03","23","6","MARISSA","So, what, you just... hate prom?"
"03","23","6","MARISSA","Why? Did you have a bad prom experience? 'Cause, hey, you know, I've heard there's support groups for things like that, and really, I think you could recover."
"03","23","7","SUMMER","I haven't spoken to you in four days. You think pancakes and chocolate chips are going to make me forget that you and Anna went behind my back?"
"03","23","7","SETH","We did not..."
"03","23","7","SUMMER","Or that I saw you guys at the airport, and your long, tearful good-bye?"
"03","23","8","THERESA","You know..."
"03","23","8","RYAN","What?"
"03","23","8","THERESA","Did I ever tell you how much my mom loves baby-sitting?"
"03","23","9","MARISSA","Well, all the more reason to go now... 'cause you'll have me there to protect you. Okay?"
"03","23","10","SUMMER","Not only will I not go to prom with you, but if you and I were stranded on a deserted island, I would take the nourishment that your meager frame has to offer, and then I would feed your bones to the sharks."
"03","23","11","ANNA","So, did she like the pancake?"
"03","23","11","SETH","Yeah, she loved it, and then she said if we were stranded on a deserted island, she'd feed my bones to the sharks."
"03","23","11","SETH","I think it's hopeless."
"03","23","11","ANNA","Oh. Wait, she doesn't really think that we..."
"03","23","11","SETH","She saw us hugging in the airport."
"03","23","11","ANNA","Oh, my God, this is all my fault."
"03","23","11","SETH","No, it's not your fault."
"03","23","11","ANNA","Yes, it is. If I hadn't been there, then you would have made up and you would be going to prom right now. You have to tell her the truth."
"03","23","11","SETH","Yeah, I tried, but..."
"03","23","11","ANNA","No, no, no, not about us. You have to tell her that you lied about getting into Brown."
"03","23","11","SETH","I don't think I can do that."
"03","23","11","ANNA","But you have to, Seth. You have no other choice. You've done everything else."
"03","23","11","SETH","Yeah, I know, but last time I lied, I had to write out this big confession of everything I'd ever done wrong, and my whole drug phase and that..."
"03","23","11","ANNA","You-you had a drug phase?"
"03","23","11","SETH","I smoked a couple of joints, but I promised I'd never lie again. I don't think she's going to forgive me."
"03","23","11","ANNA","Seth, she wants to feed your bones to sharks. You have nothing to lose."
"03","23","11","SETH","Listen, Anna, I appreciate your help, but, uh... I don't know. It's over. I give up. Anyways... I'm going to talk to you later."
"03","23","11","ANNA","Man..."
"03","23","12","KIRSTEN","You off?"
"03","23","12","SANDY","Uh, I should be home in time for dinner. Hey, isn't this prom weekend? Weren't you and Julie talking about having everybody over here for pictures?"
"03","23","12","KIRSTEN","We did... but Ryan doesn't have a date, and Seth and Summer seem to be in some kind of fight."
"03","23","12","SANDY","Oh, that's too bad. It's senior prom. It's a milestone. Maybe we should try and convince them to go anyway."
"03","23","12","KIRSTEN","Okay. When are we going to talk about us?"
"03","23","12","SANDY","In public again, or were you thinking about something a little more private this time?"
"03","23","12","KIRSTEN","I'm sorry I attacked you, but at least I got you to listen."
"03","23","12","SANDY","Well, I'm sorry I made it so difficult for you."
"03","23","12","KIRSTEN","So what do we do?"
"03","23","12","SANDY","Well, we should give the boys the weekend. They're going to be gone in a few months. And then... you and I can figure out how best to proceed. I, uh... I'm going to go."
"03","23","12","KIRSTEN","Sandy, there's something else. At the end of that dinner, I... I just wish I'd apologized then."
"03","23","12","SANDY","Oh, that's okay. We'll be fine."
"03","23","13","TAYLOR","Oh, Summer."
"03","23","13","SUMMER","Hey, Taylor."
"03","23","13","TAYLOR","Summer, wait. I have a big surprise for you. But first, business. Here are yours and Marissa's prom tickets, and I need $50 from each of you for the after-party. I rented out the Bait Shop. It is going to be such a rager."
"03","23","13","SUMMER","You know what? I don't think I'm going to go."
"03","23","13","TAYLOR","You were prom queen last year. You have to go."
"03","23","13","SUMMER","Yeah, well, the queen is dead."
"03","23","13","TAYLOR","I see. Well, perhaps you would like to hear who your date is."
"03","23","13","SUMMER","What are you talking about?"
"03","23","13","TAYLOR","I got you a date."
"03","23","13","SUMMER","Taylor!"
"03","23","13","TAYLOR","Quiet. You know how I'm going with Sung Ho?"
"03","23","13","SUMMER","The guy from the Korean barbecue?"
"03","23","13","TAYLOR","Oh, yeah, we, like, totally found each other at the sweatshirt party. He's got this wonderfully hairless body. It's like hooking up with a seal."
"03","23","13","SUMMER","I have to go."
"03","23","13","TAYLOR","So, it turns out his cousin Young Nam is visiting from Seoul. And his English is a little... but Sung Ho says he is huge on the K-pop scene."
"03","23","13","SUMMER","What the hell is K-pop?"
"03","23","13","TAYLOR","Korean pop-- K-pop. Anyway, his band's called Big Korea, and he's a model, too. They actually based a couple of anime characters on him."
"03","23","13","SUMMER","Taylor, I'm not going to go to prom with some Asian pop singer that barely speaks English."
"03","23","13","TAYLOR","Summer."
"03","23","13","SUMMER","Ow."
"03","23","13","TAYLOR","Cohen deceived you. It is your duty as a woman to make him feel pathetic and small by going to prom with the hottest guy you can find."
"03","23","13","SUMMER","That's a good point. Are you sure he's hot?"
"03","23","13","TAYLOR","Sung Ho said at his last concert, a gang of crazed school girls torched a cop car."
"03","23","13","SUMMER","Big Korea."
"03","23","14","RYAN","Hey. How you doing?"
"03","23","14","MARISSA","Hey. Good. Are those prom tickets?"
"03","23","14","RYAN","Yeah. I asked someone. Theresa, actually."
"03","23","14","MARISSA","Oh, well, that's great."
"03","23","14","RYAN","Yeah."
"03","23","14","MARISSA","So, the baby...?"
"03","23","14","RYAN","Really cute, but not mine. Well, what about you? Are you... are you going? I can't remember whether you and Volchok are still together or..."
"03","23","14","MARISSA","Yeah, on both counts."
"03","23","14","RYAN","Yeah?"
"03","23","14","MARISSA","He wasn't exactly enthusiastic, but he said yes."
"03","23","14","RYAN","Oh, that's-that's, uh... that's great."
"03","23","14","MARISSA","Yeah. Okay, I should be getting to class. Um, congratulations on the Theresa thing. See you."
"03","23","14","RYAN","See you."
"03","23","15","SETH","Summer, hey. I just, I just want to apologize for what happened in the girls' bathroom today. I didn't mean to follow you in, or spook Mrs. Rushfield. I'm just trying to explain the idea of a romance between me and Anna so insane that..."
"03","23","15","ANNA","Hello, Seth."
"03","23","15","SETH","I had to go."
"03","23","16","RYAN","I want to talk to you."
"03","23","16","RYAN","Ken, listen. I saw you on the pier last night."
"03","23","16","RYAN","Maybe you remember the girl you were with? Long hair, tattoos, not much like Marissa?"
"03","23","16","MARISSA","Hey, Kevin. I think there's like a snake in the shower... What are you doing here?"
"03","23","16","RYAN","Uh... Uh, Kirsten called. She's having people over for photos tomorrow, and I just thought I'd invite you."
"03","23","16","MARISSA","Oh, that's really sweet."
"03","23","16","MARISSA","Okay, ignore him. We'll be there."
"03","23","16","RYAN","Yeah."
"03","23","17","RYAN","Hello?"
"03","23","17","ANNA","Hey."
"03","23","17","RYAN","Hi. Anna. Seth said you were in town."
"03","23","17","ANNA","Hey, how are you?"
"03","23","17","RYAN","I'm good, and you look much more grown up. Yeah, well, don't we all? You staying with your parents?"
"03","23","17","ANNA","My aunt and my uncle. Last year, my parents switched houses. We're a quirky family."
"03","23","17","RYAN","Yeah."
"03","23","17","ANNA","Are you going to prom?"
"03","23","17","RYAN","Yeah, actually. I'm going with Theresa."
"03","23","17","SETH","Hey, there she is. Look at a true friend, Ryan. 2,000 miles she flies."
"03","23","17","ANNA","In a middle seat."
"03","23","17","SETH","All to make sure Summer and I go to the prom together. Now, tell me, would you do so much? Let's not test it."
"03","23","17","ANNA","Well, guilt could be a powerful motivator."
"03","23","17","SETH","I'd tell you again that it's not your fault, except I want to hear this plan."
"03","23","17","ANNA","In phase one..."
"03","23","17","SETH","Uh! Hear that, Ryan? Phase one. That suggests multiple phases."
"03","23","17","ANNA","In phase one, I am going to go over to Summer's right now, and tell her that there is nothing going on between us."
"03","23","17","SETH","Okay. Out of curiosity, what you got for phase two?"
"03","23","17","ANNA","In the off-chance that phase one fails, phase two-- you take me to prom. I brought a dress. Yeah, I better get going. I'll call you. See you later."
"03","23","17","RYAN","Bye-bye."
"03","23","17","SETH","Bye."
"03","23","18","MARISSA","I don't know, I kind of like it."
"03","23","18","SUMMER","I'm going to kill Taylor."
"03","23","18","MARISSA","Why? Come on. He's cute."
"03","23","18","SUMMER","How can you tell? He's in a space suit."
"03","23","18","MARISSA","So do you think Kevin will like this?"
"03","23","18","SUMMER","Yeah, if it rips off easy. This was supposed to make Seth jealous."
"03","23","18","MARISSA","What's that?"
"03","23","18","SUMMER","Just Seth's napkin confession, detailing all his lies and deceptions, including his pathetic two-week stoner phase. You know what? I think it is time for Sandy and Kirsten to know their son a little better."
"03","23","18","MARISSA","What? Summer, you can't do that."
"03","23","18","SUMMER","Oh, I can. We had a deal. He told me that if he screwed up, I could show this to his parents. Revenge."
"03","23","18","MARISSA","Don't you think that maybe he's telling the truth about him and Anna? I mean, do you really think that they would do that to you?"
"03","23","18","ANNA","Hi. I hope I'm not interrupting anything."
"03","23","18","SUMMER","Oh, my God."
"03","23","18","MARISSA","No. Hi, Anna. It's good to see you again."
"03","23","18","ANNA","You, too."
"03","23","18","MARISSA","I'm going to go... try this on."
"03","23","18","SUMMER","I need you. What are you doing here?"
"03","23","18","ANNA","Summer, I wanted to talk to you. You have to believe me. There is nothing going on between me and Seth. You are still my Blanche, you know?"
"03","23","18","SUMMER","Nice try. I saw you guys hugging at the airport."
"03","23","18","ANNA","That was... not what you think it was. We were celebrating."
"03","23","18","SUMMER","Celebrating what?"
"03","23","18","ANNA","The future."
"03","23","18","SUMMER","If I flew 2,000 miles, I'd probably come up with a better story."
"03","23","18","ANNA","No, it's the truth. Seth..."
"03","23","18","SUMMER","Look. My date's going to be here soon. He's kind of a rock star. You may have heard of him, Big Korea. Yeah. Well, not surprised. Thanks for coming by."
"03","23","18","ANNA","Summer... Look, Summer, I'm sorry that you don't believe me, but if you're already going with someone, would you mind if I went with Seth?"
"03","23","18","SUMMER","Why would I mind?"
"03","23","18","ANNA","Okay, then. I'll see you there."
"03","23","18","SUMMER","See ya."
"03","23","19","RYAN","So, uh, how exactly does this plan go again?"
"03","23","19","SETH","Summer sees me with Anna at the dance, and confronted with the reality of a world without Seth Cohen, she comes to her senses."
"03","23","19","RYAN","Uh-huh, because a world without you..."
"03","23","19","SETH","Is a world without sun. Ryan, it's a world without warmth. I don't get it, either, but I think we should trust Anna on this one. She has more knowledge of the female psyche than either you or I could hope for."
"03","23","19","RYAN","That's so true."
"03","23","19","ANNA","Aren't you guys ready yet? People are going to be here. What is it? What's wrong?"
"03","23","19","SETH","No. You look... I'm getting ready still."
"03","23","20","SANDY","Hello, welcome."
"03","23","20","SANDY","How are you? Nice to see you. Come on in."
"03","23","20","SUMMER","You look beautiful."
"03","23","20","THERESA","You, too."
"03","23","20","SETH","That's Summer's date. Looks like the guy in Full Metal Alchemist."
"03","23","20","SANDY","Kirsten, here are the Yangs, Elena and Tom."
"03","23","20","RYAN","Hey. How are you?"
"03","23","20","MARISSA","Hey."
"03","23","20","THERESA","Hi."
"03","23","20","MARISSA","Oh, my God, you look beautiful."
"03","23","20","THERESA","You too. It's good to see you."
"03","23","20","RYAN","Glad you could make it."
"03","23","20","TAYLOR","Ryan. I'm so glad that you and Seth found dates."
"03","23","20","RYAN","Thank you."
"03","23","20","TAYLOR","So I'm going to need 50 bucks from each of you for the after-party."
"03","23","20","SANDY","Oh, I'll take care of that. There you go."
"03","23","20","TAYLOR","Thank you, very much Mr. Cohen."
"03","23","20","RYAN","Uh... down the hall."
"03","23","21","JULIE","Okay, you guys, we all need one with all of the kids. Get together."
"03","23","21","MARISSA","Oh, hey. Has anyone seen Kevin? I think he's still in the bathroom."
"03","23","21","RYAN","All right, I'll get him."
"03","23","22","RYAN","The, uh, the parents want to take a photo of everyone. We're waiting on you."
"03","23","22","RYAN","Look."
"03","23","22","RYAN","No, actually I don't have a problem with your drinking, but if you screw this up for Marissa, I'm going to kick your ass."
"03","23","23","SETH","Oh, my God. You know what this is?"
"03","23","23","ANNA","What?"
"03","23","23","SETH","This is the pirates' cave from Goonies. I've died and gone to heaven."
"03","23","23","SUMMER","Taylor, this is amazing."
"03","23","23","MARISSA","Yeah, this is way better than any dance I ever designed."
"03","23","23","TAYLOR","Oh, my God, Marissa, that means so much to me. You know, I've been saying that, but no one listens."
"03","23","23","ANNA","Wow, Seth, you and I at prom together, who would have thought."
"03","23","23","SETH","I know. I guess sometimes things just work out."
"03","23","23","SUMMER","Laughing boy. Hi. Where's that flask you're always whipping out?"
"03","23","23","SUMMER","Read my mind."
"03","23","23","MARISSA","That's so unlike you."
"03","23","23","SUMMER","Big Korea. Hi. Hi. Come on, go."
"03","23","23","TAYLOR","Why don't I go put my purse down and then we can hit the dance floor?"
"03","23","23","TAYLOR","Okay."
"03","23","23","SETH","You sure about this?"
"03","23","23","ANNA","Yes, Seth, you're just going to have to trust me. Come on, let's go take a picture with Captain Hook."
"03","23","23","SETH","All right."
"03","23","23","ANNA","Come on."
"03","23","23","TAYLOR","Oh, hi, Lisa."
"03","23","23","TAYLOR","I'm so glad you made it back for prom."
"03","23","23","TAYLOR","Oh, by the way, do you know where Simon gets those skintight V-necks? I totally want to get one for Sung Ho."
"03","23","23","MARISSA","Have I thanked you yet for coming?"
"03","23","23","MARISSA","Is something wrong?"
"03","23","23","MARISSA","Yeah, well, I'm sure she'll bring it back."
"03","23","23","MARISSA","You know, I actually kind of want to enjoy prom, but come find me when you get back."
"03","23","24","SANDY","Maybe I'm being sentimental, but watching the kids head off to the senior prom, I can't help but think, where did the time go."
"03","23","24","JULIE","Of course."
"03","23","24","KIRSTEN","And wasn't it kindergarten that Seth would only answer to Boba Fett?"
"03","23","24","SANDY","Gosh, Boba Fett. That was fourth grade."
"03","23","24","KIRSTEN","No, it was fifth grade."
"03","23","24","JULIE","Gosh, you know, I just can't believe that I was only a year older than Marissa is now when I married Jimmy. It's amazing the surprises life brings you."
"03","23","24","JULIE","Very good."
"03","23","24","KIRSTEN","I'd like to propose a toast to the two of you. I'm sorry Sandy and I haven't thrown you an engagement party, but we couldn't be more pleased."
"03","23","24","SANDY","Thank you."
"03","23","24","KIRSTEN","Cheers."
"03","23","24","JULIE","Cheers."
"03","23","24","JULIE","Such a busy man."
"03","23","24","JULIE","Well, I just hope Neil and I are as happy as you and Sandy."
"03","23","25","SETH","All right, I feel good about that."
"03","23","25","ANNA","All right."
"03","23","25","SETH","Why don't we go dance?"
"03","23","25","ANNA","Thank you. Like dancing..."
"03","23","25","SETH","I'm just going to go talk to her."
"03","23","25","ANNA","No, Seth, you can't."
"03","23","25","SETH","Well, look at her-- she looks miserable. Let alone... kind of plastered."
"03","23","25","ANNA","Well, that's the point. At least the miserable part."
"03","23","25","SETH","I don't think I can do this."
"03","23","25","ANNA","Seth, the plan is working. I mean, it was easy for her to doubt you when you're all begging to get back together with her. But now that she might have really lost you, she's thinking, maybe I should have really believed him."
"03","23","25","SETH","Really? 'Cause it looks to me like she's describing how she'd use my body for food then feed my bones to the sharks."
"03","23","25","TAYLOR","Excuse me, can I have your attention, please? Hi. I would like to welcome you all to the Pirate's Ball. Thank you. Okay, now, uh, before I announce your pirate king and queen, I would just like to take this moment to... say that it's been an honor to be your social chair this year..."
"03","23","25","TAYLOR","Fine. Oh, um, just so you know, I thought it was only fair to take myself out of the running so no calling for a recount. Okay, uh... Your 2006 queen is... Oh, my God, two years in a row, Summer Roberts."
"03","23","25","SETH","Oh, my God."
"03","23","25","MARISSA","Go, Summ!"
"03","23","25","SUMMER","Oh, my God. I don't think you're boring. I love you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I like you guys, thank you so much. You guys... What's going on? Oh, tiara. Oh, tiara. Okay, thanks. Um, yeah, so thank you so much because being your queen is just... Is it like a million degrees in here or what? Woo, it's hot."
"03","23","25","TAYLOR","You know what? Perhaps we should find out who your king is."
"03","23","25","SUMMER","Screw that. You know what? Actually, let me, um... introduce you to my date. Hold this. He's right here. This is my date. He is the number one pop star in Korea."
"03","23","25","SUMMER","Anyway, I promised him that if I won that I would give him a big fat kiss."
"03","23","25","SETH","This is not part of the plan."
"03","23","25","ANNA","She's just fighting it. This is good."
"03","23","25","SUMMER","How do you like that, Cohen?"
"03","23","25","TAYLOR","Man overboard! Man overboard!"
"03","23","25","MARISSA","Oh, my God. Are you okay?"
"03","23","25","SUMMER","What idiot made that stage so short?"
"03","23","25","SETH","Summer, are you okay?"
"03","23","25","SUMMER","Back off."
"03","23","25","MARISSA","Whoa, um."
"03","23","25","SUMMER","Just, everyone leave me alone."
"03","23","25","SETH","She probably just needs a moist washcloth or maybe like a towelette."
"03","23","25","ANNA","Cohen."
"03","23","25","SETH","What? What? Is there a ""no towelette"" clause in your plan? Because right now I'm thinking phase two kind of sucks. Does anyone have a towelette? Does anyone have a towelette? We must find a towelette!"
"03","23","25","RYAN","Is she all right?"
"03","23","25","MARISSA","Yeah, I think maybe it's time to go to the after-party, though."
"03","23","25","RYAN","That's a good idea."
"03","23","25","MARISSA","Hey, I couldn't find Kevin. He just disappeared."
"03","23","25","RYAN","Okay, I'll find him."
"03","23","25","MARISSA","Oh, right, I better go..."
"03","23","25","RYAN","Who is it?"
"03","23","25","THERESA","Um, this is the guy, I... I told him I was coming here tonight and I should probably take this."
"03","23","25","RYAN","I'm sorry, I know, it's gotten a little crazy."
"03","23","25","THERESA","Yeah. A little crazy."
"03","23","25","RYAN","Little bit."
"03","23","25","THERESA","But there's no place that I would rather be. And that's what I'm going to tell him. I'll see you in a minute."
"03","23","25","MARISSA","Ryan?"
"03","23","25","RYAN","Hey, what are you doing?"
"03","23","25","MARISSA","So Sung Ho and his cousin got Summ in the limo, but have you found Kevin?"
"03","23","25","RYAN","No, no, let's look inside."
"03","23","25","MARISSA","Oh, he might have come out here to smoke."
"03","23","25","RYAN","No, he didn't, I checked."
"03","23","25","MARISSA","You checked?"
"03","23","25","RYAN","Yeah."
"03","23","25","MARISSA","Why are you being weird? Are you sure he's not out here? Oh, my God."
"03","23","25","MARISSA","Why?"
"03","23","25","MARISSA","You know it's not like that."
"03","23","25","MARISSA","You're nothing like him. Clearly, I was wrong about you."
"03","23","26","JULIE","Honestly, Kirsten, I'm so glad you guys are doing better. You really scared me last week."
"03","23","26","KIRSTEN","I even scared myself. Julie... last week at dinner, I had a drink."
"03","23","26","JULIE","What?! Oh, my God."
"03","23","26","KIRSTEN","Now, it was the first in 11 months, it was only one glass, I've been going to AA meetings every day, but it happened."
"03","23","26","JULIE","Have you talked to Sandy about this?"
"03","23","26","KIRSTEN","No. I tried, even before when I could feel it coming, but..."
"03","23","26","JULIE","Kirsten, you have to tell him."
"03","23","26","KIRSTEN","That the stress of our marriage has triggered my drinking?"
"03","23","26","JULIE","Yes, that's exactly what you say."
"03","23","26","KIRSTEN","I am not gonna use my alcoholism as blackmail to save our marriage. If he can't value it for what it is, then what is the point?"
"03","23","26","JULIE","Well, what are you gonna do?"
"03","23","26","KIRSTEN","I don't know. The way things are between Sandy and I right now, I just feel like one push could send us over the edge."
"03","23","27","TAYLOR","Hello? Trash cans exist for a reason. Oh... Excuse me. Hi. I have a security deposit on this place, and I'd like it back."
"03","23","27","RYAN","Hey, so, the guy at the door is gonna let me know if Volchek tries to get in. How you doing?"
"03","23","27","MARISSA","I'm okay. You know, I think I'm just gonna go home, though."
"03","23","27","THERESA","Marissa, this is your prom."
"03","23","27","MARISSA","Yeah, it was prom before my boyfriend hooked up with another girl. Um... okay, I'm gonna go get a drink."
"03","23","28","SETH","Summer, it's us. How you feeling?"
"03","23","28","SUMMER","Go away, let me die alone."
"03","23","28","ANNA","I think it's time for phase three."
"03","23","28","SETH","There's a phase three? Why didn't you mention that before?"
"03","23","28","ANNA","Duh, there's always been a phase three. The other two were just to make you realize that you don't have a choice. You have to tell her the truth, about everything."
"03","23","28","SUMMER","Who is she talking about? I bet you think it's really smart because she's the smart girl."
"03","23","28","ANNA","I'm gonna go. I fly back tomorrow, but I'll see you both in Providence. Summer, feel better. And remember Seth loves you."
"03","23","28","SETH","Anna, thank you."
"03","23","28","ANNA","Bye."
"03","23","28","SUMMER","You know what? I don't think she's that smart. I think that she's dumb. She's got a dumb name and dumb hair."
"03","23","28","SETH","Listen, I don't expect you to respond or even remember this, but the truth is, I actually didn't get in to Brown."
"03","23","28","SUMMER","What?! Too fast."
"03","23","28","SETH","I knew you weren't gonna go if I didn't go, and I didn't want you to do that, and I didn't want you to miss the opportunity, so I broke up with you."
"03","23","28","SUMMER","That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard."
"03","23","28","SETH","Yeah, well, then I realized I couldn't be without you, so I flew there to try and talk my way in."
"03","23","28","SUMMER","Okay, now that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. But it's very romantic. Did it work?"
"03","23","28","SETH","No, it didn't. But Anna got me an interview at RISD, and they read my comic book, and they really liked it, so..."
"03","23","28","SUMMER","So that's why you were hugging her at the airport? Oh, my God."
"03","23","28","SETH","Listen, I know I promised I'd never lie again when I gave you that letter."
"03","23","28","SUMMER","Oh, my God, the letter."
"03","23","28","SETH","What?"
"03","23","28","SUMMER","Cohen, I have a confession."
"03","23","28","SETH","Oh, wow. Wow, that's impressive."
"03","23","28","SUMMER","I love you."
"03","23","28","SETH","I love you, too. We can kiss later. All right, want me to hold your crown?"
"03","23","28","SUMMER","No!"
"03","23","28","SETH","All right. Hey... rigatoni-- nice."
"03","23","29","SANDY","What's going on?"
"03","23","29","JULIE","Neil, it's getting late-- I think we should be going."
"03","23","29","KIRSTEN","Oh, my pleasure."
"03","23","29","JULIE","Well, we'll walk you out."
"03","23","29","KIRSTEN","Is everything okay?"
"03","23","29","SANDY","Yeah."
"03","23","30","RYAN","Well, she's not here-- she must've gone home."
"03","23","30","THERESA","She'll be okay. You know, you probably don't see it, but she's changed. She's gotten stronger. So have you."
"03","23","30","RYAN","Yeah? Think so?"
"03","23","30","THERESA","The Ryan I knew would've gotten in a fight with that guy back at the prom. I know part of you still wants to, but you didn't. And that's what matters."
"03","23","30","RYAN","So, you like the new me."
"03","23","30","THERESA","Well... he's still not much of a dancer, but..."
"03","23","30","RYAN","What?! You're right, I'm not."
"03","23","30","THERESA","You know, nothing between us could ever be casual-- there's too much history."
"03","23","30","RYAN","Yeah, I know. I just don't think that anything should happen tonight."
"03","23","30","THERESA","Absolutely not. Absolutely..."
"03","23","30","RYAN","Okay, good."
"03","23","30","TAYLOR","Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!"
"03","23","30","RYAN","Taylor, what happened?"
"03","23","30","RYAN","We should call the police. You know what, don't bother, don't bother. I know where it is."
"03","23","30","TAYLOR","What do you mean, you know? I think I'm gonna hyperventilate."
"03","23","30","THERESA","Is everything okay?"
"03","23","30","RYAN","Yeah, it will be."
"03","23","31","RYAN","You decide how this is gonna go."
"03","23","31","RYAN","I don't think about you. But yes, you're an idiot."
"03","23","31","RYAN","I'm not here to fight you."
"03","23","31","RYAN","All right, all right, all right, I get it-- it's about the money."
"03","24","0","RYAN","Can we get some help over here?!"
"03","24","0","RYAN","No, no."
"03","24","0","RYAN","I got him here as soon as I could."
"03","24","0","RYAN","Yeah, okay."
"03","24","1","MARISSA","Kait... Kaitlin?"
"03","24","1","KAITLIN","Hey, sis."
"03","24","1","MARISSA","Hey. You just calling to say hi?"
"03","24","1","KAITLIN","Totally. So how's your life? How's Ryan? What'd you do last night? Give me all the deets."
"03","24","1","MARISSA","Well, Ryan and I broke up and my prom date got with another girl."
"03","24","1","KAITLIN","Ah, really? That's great. Listen, I'm actually calling you to ask you a favor."
"03","24","1","MARISSA","What, your friend Megan needs another abortion?"
"03","24","1","KAITLIN","I wish. But, um, actually, my school sent Mom a letter and I kind of need you to get it for me."
"03","24","1","MARISSA","And by ""get,"" do you mean keep it from her?"
"03","24","1","KAITLIN","Look, I'm totally all over this situation. I just need a little bit more time."
"03","24","1","MARISSA","Oh, Kaitlin..."
"03","24","1","KAITLIN","Look, Marissa, I'm begging you. If you have one sisterly bone in your body, you will do this for me. Please?"
"03","24","1","MARISSA","Fine, I'll see if it's there, but you have to promise to tell me why."
"03","24","1","KAITLIN","Oh, thank you. I love you."
"03","24","1","MARISSA","Okay, I love you... too."
"03","24","2","RYAN","Hi."
"03","24","2","THERESA","Hi, what are you doing?"
"03","24","2","RYAN","Nothing much. How 'bout you?"
"03","24","2","THERESA","Just got off the phone with the guy."
"03","24","2","RYAN","Oh. The, uh... work guy. How'd that go?"
"03","24","2","THERESA","Oh, not well. It's kind of hard for a 28-year-old to understand prom."
"03","24","2","RYAN","I get that. You don't regret going, do you?"
"03","24","2","THERESA","No, not at all. I had fun. And after you left, things got pretty interesting in the limo with Taylor and the dates... and I don't know what the Korean word for ""threesome"" is, but I'm pretty sure it was used. Ryan?"
"03","24","2","RYAN","Yep."
"03","24","2","THERESA","That thing that you had to take care of last night..."
"03","24","2","RYAN","It's taken care of."
"03","24","2","THERESA","Okay. Do you want to hang out today?"
"03","24","2","RYAN","I have to do something this afternoon. I'm not sure how long it's gonna take."
"03","24","2","THERESA","Well, how about later for dinner? I could bring over takeout."
"03","24","2","RYAN","Yeah, that sounds good."
"03","24","2","THERESA","Okay."
"03","24","2","RYAN","Yeah, okay."
"03","24","2","SETH","Hey, man. Today's a good day for me, Ryan. I finally came clean, told the truth about not getting into Brown and things are great. Life is so much better when you're honest. You just mean what you say, you say what you mean. I feel like you."
"03","24","2","RYAN","Well, now that you're on a roll, you gonna tell Sandy and Kirsten about Brown, too?"
"03","24","2","SETH","Yeah, I don't think so. I'm going to wait a little bit on that one. I think it'll go down a bit easier with an acceptance letter to RISD in my hand."
"03","24","2","RYAN","And what if they find out first?"
"03","24","2","SETH","They won't. Things are finally going good between Summer and I. Can't this family have one weekend without a major crisis?"
"03","24","3","MARISSA","Hey, Summ. How are you?"
"03","24","3","SUMMER","I wish I could pluck out my eyeballs with a fork and rinse them in a tall glass of ice water."
"03","24","3","MARISSA","Yeah, that's a hangover. You were pretty wasted last night."
"03","24","3","SUMMER","I was, wasn't I? I don't even remember getting home. I woke up this morning and my ears were ringing and I realized it was your phone."
"03","24","3","MARISSA","Yeah, Kaitlin was calling 'cause there's this letter from her school that she wants me to grab."
"03","24","3","SUMMER","Oh, my God. Oh, my God, the letter."
"03","24","3","MARISSA","What? How do you know what it is?"
"03","24","3","SUMMER","No, no, Cohen's confession. I left it in an envelope on Sandy's desk."
"03","24","3","MARISSA","Oh, so call Seth. Tell him to grab it."
"03","24","3","SUMMER","I can't. Things are finally normal again between us. Oh, my gosh, once he realizes what I did. I gotta go. Oh, my God, nausea tsunami."
"03","24","4","SANDY","Well, it's a little unexpected. I mean, this hospital project has been, uh... it's been complicated. Oh, well... I'm glad to hear it. I look forward to tomorrow night. Thank you. You're not going to believe this. I am Riviera magazine's Man of the Year. Try not to faint."
"03","24","4","KIRSTEN","I'm sorry, it's just given everything that's happened..."
"03","24","4","SANDY","They're calling the hospital phase one of Orange County's renaissance, thinking it could be a model for responsible development for the entire country."
"03","24","4","KIRSTEN","Responsible development? Sandy, the only thing it's responsible for is a lot of sleepless nights and Matt Ramsey's black eye. You know my father was Man of the Year."
"03","24","4","SANDY","The irony is not lost on me, believe me. But, hey, this could mean that maybe the dark days are over, that something good is coming from all this."
"03","24","4","KIRSTEN","I'd like to think so. But I honestly doubt it."
"03","24","4","SANDY","Well, I wasn't expecting your blessing. But until we have proof to the contrary, let's try to be optimistic."
"03","24","4","RYAN","Hey."
"03","24","4","KIRSTEN","Why don't you say good morning to Newport's Man of the Year?"
"03","24","4","SETH","I knew it was only a matter of time before this town recognized my contribution to the community."
"03","24","4","RYAN","Have to be a man first. Congratulations, Sandy."
"03","24","4","SANDY","Thank you. Big party tomorrow night. Everybody's got to dress up and represent."
"03","24","4","KIRSTEN","And just think, I couldn't get you to wear a tie at cotillion."
"03","24","4","SANDY","College letters, senior prom... this family's on a streak. Let's try to enjoy it."
"03","24","4","RYAN","I gotta go."
"03","24","4","SANDY","Me, too."
"03","24","4","SETH","You excited?"
"03","24","4","KIRSTEN","It'll be good for your father's career."
"03","24","5","SUMMER","Oh, my God, Mr. C, you totally scared me."
"03","24","5","SANDY","Sometimes I scare myself, Summer. Seth's in the kitchen."
"03","24","5","SUMMER","I'll just go right in."
"03","24","5","SANDY","All right."
"03","24","5","SETH","What are you doing?"
"03","24","5","SUMMER","Nothing. Looking for stamps."
"03","24","5","SETH","Are you mailing a letter?"
"03","24","5","SUMMER","Not without stamps. Let's go make out upstairs."
"03","24","6","MARISSA","Hey, is everything okay? You sounded weird on the phone."
"03","24","6","RYAN","You can give that to Taylor."
"03","24","6","MARISSA","What, her after-party money?"
"03","24","6","RYAN","Yeah, it was stolen at the prom."
"03","24","6","MARISSA","Kevin... I can't believe he stole that. I should go over there and kick his..."
"03","24","6","RYAN","No, no, no, no. We got the money, so forget it. Uh, just, uh, I don't really want to talk about it. But if you could just give that to Taylor, no questions ask, that'd be good."
"03","24","6","MARISSA","Yeah. You can count on me. I need to focus on other stuff anyway. I was gonna take a road trip this weekend. So, maybe I should just go home and pack."
"03","24","6","RYAN","Can I buy you breakfast?"
"03","24","6","MARISSA","Sure."
"03","24","7","SUMMER","Where is your dad going this morning?"
"03","24","7","SETH","You thinking about my dad?"
"03","24","7","SUMMER","He had his briefcase with him. Does he usually keep important papers in there?"
"03","24","7","SETH","Whoa, you turned me on."
"03","24","7","SUMMER","I'm sorry. Cohen, there's something I need to tell you."
"03","24","7","SETH","You're using me to get to my father?"
"03","24","7","SUMMER","Serious."
"03","24","7","SETH","So is this. We just got back together. The window for a makeup hookup is rapidly closing unless you want to break up again."
"03","24","7","SUMMER","No, definitely not."
"03","24","7","SETH","Okay, so what do you have to tell me?"
"03","24","7","SUMMER","I want to be on top this time."
"03","24","7","SETH","You are always on top."
"03","24","8","JULIE","Of course, we'll be there. Hey, it's something to celebrate. Okay, bye, Kiks. Huh."
"03","24","8","JULIE","Yes. Sandy Cohen has just been named Newport's Man of the Year. There's a party for him tomorrow night at the yacht club."
"03","24","8","JULIE","What do you mean?"
"03","24","8","JULIE","Oh, wow. I mean, Sandy is obviously very involved with the hospital, but I can't imagine him doing anything unethical. He can be self-righteous, pompous and annoying, but... Sandy is very moral."
"03","24","8","JULIE","So we have to warn Sandy."
"03","24","8","JULIE","Then why doesn't Kirsten know?"
"03","24","9","RYAN","How you doing?"
"03","24","9","RYAN","I'm glad. I didn't mean to, uh... Well, not that bad anyway."
"03","24","9","RYAN","So the money is returned, you got your stitches and... we're good, right?"
"03","24","9","RYAN","No, no, no, no..."
"03","24","9","RYAN","Whatever you're into, drugs, guns..."
"03","24","9","RYAN","I know, and I don't want it to be."
"03","24","9","RYAN","You tell the cops about me, and I'll tell them about the money."
"03","24","9","RYAN","Nobody's gonna believe you?"
"03","24","9","RYAN","No, no, I can't tomorrow night. Sandy's Man of the Year's big party."
"03","24","10","MARISSA","Oh, uh... Marissa. Kaitlin's sister."
"03","24","10","KAITLIN","Marissa, what are you doing here?"
"03","24","10","MARISSA","Waiting for you to explain this."
"03","24","11","JULIE","Thanks for coming by, Kiks. I didn't want to talk to you about this on the phone."
"03","24","11","KIRSTEN","No, of course, no problem. What's going on?"
"03","24","11","JULIE","Um, sit down. Uh, it's Sandy. He's being investigated by the DA."
"03","24","11","JULIE","Yeah. Neil is meeting with the DA tomorrow. It seems serious. I'm so sorry, Kirsten. I just thought you should know."
"03","24","11","KIRSTEN","No, of course. Especially with Sandy being Man of the Year. It'll be in all the papers."
"03","24","11","JULIE","And speaking of someone who's had to manage more than her share of scandal, you need to contain this ASAP."
"03","24","11","KIRSTEN","Julie, I appreciate the heads-up. Sandy's going to take this really hard."
"03","24","11","JULIE","Sandy knows. Neil told him at dinner last night."
"03","24","12","RYAN","So your mom has the baby?"
"03","24","12","THERESA","Mm. The nanny. What, when we were growing up stealing all those empties to buy Sour Patch Kids, you didn't imagine me as the kind of girl hat would have a nanny?"
"03","24","12","RYAN","Uh, you've come a long way, is all."
"03","24","12","THERESA","So have you. You're graduating on Monday and Berkeley in the fall. So last night after you left me with Taylor..."
"03","24","12","RYAN","Just don't, okay?"
"03","24","12","THERESA","Look, Ryan, there's only one thing that could have done that to your hand, and that's another guy's face. That kid stole the money, and you went to fight him. Go ahead. Answer it."
"03","24","12","RYAN","Hi. No, no, no, I cannot right now, okay? Well, give me a couple of hours at least."
"03","24","12","THERESA","You should have told them you'd be right there."
"03","24","12","RYAN","Teresa, Teresa! Look, there's things that I... that I can't tell the Cohens or Seth because they wouldn't understand it, but you..."
"03","24","12","THERESA","My life has totally changed since we were kids."
"03","24","12","RYAN","So has mine."
"03","24","12","THERESA","No, Ryan, there are guys out there that don't get in fights, not ever, not any."
"03","24","12","RYAN","Like the guy at work?"
"03","24","12","THERESA","Look, I have a child to think about now, okay? And I cannot be with someone like my brother or yours."
"03","24","12","RYAN","Well, I'm not like him."
"03","24","12","THERESA","Maybe on your good days, you're not, but right now, my life isn't built for the bad ones. I will always love you, Ryan. Keep safe."
"03","24","13","KIRSTEN","You walked into the kitchen the morning and asked me to be optimistic."
"03","24","13","SANDY","Well, they can't have much of a case, not against Griffin and certainly not against me. I'm hoping the whole thing will go away, and maybe the Man of the Year thing will help that."
"03","24","13","KIRSTEN","Well, it's not. Neil Roberts is meeting with the district attorney tomorrow."
"03","24","13","KIRSTEN","It already has."
"03","24","14","KAITLIN","His name is Trevor Knightly, and he's the captain of the lacrosse team."
"03","24","14","KAITLIN","He's a total perv, and really into Adderall."
"03","24","14","MARISSA","So what's he got against you? Or should I even ask?"
"03","24","14","KAITLIN","He gave me a personal invitation to a lipstick party, and I declined."
"03","24","14","MARISSA","I'm sensing a generation gap."
"03","24","14","KAITLIN","So the next morning, he was all telling the headmistress that he saw me taking the crest above her office."
"03","24","14","MARISSA","Well, it sounds like it's his word against yours."
"03","24","14","KAITLIN","Not exactly the perfect student."
"03","24","14","MARISSA","You don't say."
"03","24","14","KAITLIN","Look, Marissa, this will be my third strike, and I really don't feel like getting kicked out. I mean, I know it may not be as bad as shooting somebody, but I'm pretty sure Mom would freak out. And by the way, I really don't feel like getting locked up during summer."
"03","24","14","KAITLIN","Oh, honey, you're always horny."
"03","24","14","KAITLIN","You shut up."
"03","24","14","MARISSA","Okay, both of you shut up. So what's the deal with this crest thing?"
"03","24","14","KAITLIN","I'm pretty sure it's in his room, but there's no way that he or any of his army of probably-gay and totally-in-love-with-him homeboys would let me in there."
"03","24","14","MARISSA","Well, I'm not usually one to come up with a plan, but do you have one of those skirts?"
"03","24","15","RYAN","Hi."
"03","24","15","RYAN","This is my neighborhood."
"03","24","16","SETH","Mom, I'm going to go get something to eat with Summer. Are you decent? If I come in, am I inviting years of therapy? Sorry. Mom?"
"03","24","16","SUMMER","There you are, you... Ooh. Sorry. Cohen, is your mom sick or something?"
"03","24","16","SETH","Yeah, she is. I'm going to have to stay and take care of her."
"03","24","16","SUMMER","Okay, well, then why don't I just go pick us up food, and I'll bring it back. Do you think your mom needs anything?"
"03","24","16","SETH","Just peace and quiet. We're gonna have to rain-check dinner."
"03","24","16","SUMMER","Cohen, you're acting really weird."
"03","24","16","SETH","I feel weird, you know? Maybe whatever my mom has is contagious, and I'd hate for you to catch it and feel weird, too. You know?"
"03","24","16","SUMMER","Well, okay."
"03","24","17","MARISSA","Hi. Are you Trevor?"
"03","24","17","MARISSA","I'm Marissa, the new foreign exchange student. I just got here from London."
"03","24","17","MARISSA","Well, I was hoping you could give me a tour. Starting with your dorm room?"
"03","24","17","MARISSA","Okay, fine, I'm a stripper. Your friends hired me for your birthday."
"03","24","17","MARISSA","Do you want to see me take my clothes off or not?"
"03","24","18","SETH","Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?"
"03","24","18","KIRSTEN","Sure. Oh, you mean right now."
"03","24","18","SETH","Yeah. Well, you know, just kinda..."
"03","24","18","KIRSTEN","Well, can it wait till after? Because I'm on my way to a meeting with my group."
"03","24","18","SETH","Yeah, how is that going?"
"03","24","18","KIRSTEN","Well, you know what they say. One day at a time. That's why I have meetings."
"03","24","19","SANDY","Greg Otis, my favorite DA. Now, this is a cozy spot. The lighting's a lot more flattering than an interrogation room."
"03","24","19","SANDY","Good to see you."
"03","24","19","SANDY","Oh, not as much as he misses the courtroom, believe me. We've known each other a long time, Otis. What am I dealing with here?"
"03","24","19","SANDY","Well, where do I fit in the picture?"
"03","24","19","SANDY","Well, what if you had receipts, e-mails? An eyewitness?"
"03","24","19","SANDY","In exchange for my cooperation, could you let The Newport Group finish the hospital?"
"03","24","19","SANDY","So I could keep my mouth shut and hope you lose."
"03","24","19","SANDY","Thanks for your time, Otis. I'm gonna leave you two to your discussion. Good to see you, Neil."
"03","24","20","RYAN","You said we were picking something up."
"03","24","20","RYAN","Hey."
"03","24","20","RYAN","It is."
"03","24","20","RYAN","Will do."
"03","24","21","MARISSA","Yeah, well, you don't want people to walk in on us, do you? So, take off your pants."
"03","24","21","MARISSA","Haven't you ever been to Vegas? In your boxers, or I'll have to give those guys their money back."
"03","24","21","MARISSA","They do everything in Vegas. Okay. Now, I just have to go change."
"03","24","21","KAITLIN","Did you get 'em?"
"03","24","21","MARISSA","Yeah."
"03","24","21","KAITLIN","All right."
"03","24","21","MARISSA","We gotta go."
"03","24","22","SANDY","Hey."
"03","24","22","SUMMER","Hi, Mr. Cohen. Is Seth around?"
"03","24","22","SANDY","No. I don't think so. Is it okay if I just, um, wait here for him?"
"03","24","22","SANDY","Sure. Make yourself at home."
"03","24","22","SUMMER","Do you mind if I-I wait here with you?"
"03","24","22","SANDY","I'm... I'm working, but, uh... suit yourself."
"03","24","22","SUMMER","So, uh, how's Mrs. Cohen? She feeling any better?"
"03","24","22","SANDY","I didn't know she was sick."
"03","24","22","SUMMER","Huh. Must have been like a 24-hour thing."
"03","24","22","SANDY","So what's this?"
"03","24","22","SUMMER","That is a card for Seth congratulating him on having a dad who was Man of the Year."
"03","24","22","SANDY","Even though it's addressed to Kirsten and me?"
"03","24","22","SUMMER","Okay, that is actually like a really big mistake, and I would do anything to take it back."
"03","24","22","SANDY","""The most recent and troubling lies include..."" Oh, Summer."
"03","24","22","SUMMER","Seth gave it to me on Valentine's Day when we got in a fight, and he said that if he ever screwed up again, that I should give it to you. Only he didn't screw up again. I did."
"03","24","22","SANDY","This is serious."
"03","24","22","SUMMER","I did it out of spite. He told me that he wasn't going to Brown and then I saw him there with Anna."
"03","24","22","SANDY","He said he wasn't going to Brown?"
"03","24","22","SUMMER","Well, yeah, because he didn't get in but that was before RISD."
"03","24","22","SANDY","What do you mean, he didn't get in?"
"03","24","22","SUMMER","I thought he only lied about that to me."
"03","24","23","KIRSTEN","The only thing worse than relapsing... is that my husband doesn't know. He's involved in this business deal and... it's gotten very ugly and, uh... Well, he might even be arrested. And I'm not blaming anyone. I'm the only one with the power to drink or not drink. I just... really need the man I married right now."
"03","24","24","SANDY","I want to talk to you."
"03","24","24","SETH","Good, I want to talk to you."
"03","24","24","SANDY","I love you... and I'm worried about you."
"03","24","24","SETH","Right back at you."
"03","24","24","SANDY","You smoked pot in our home."
"03","24","24","SETH","Would you rather I do it somewhere else, like my college dorm?"
"03","24","24","SANDY","That would require you getting into college."
"03","24","24","SETH","Well, do you think it's such a great idea, me going away to college when Mom's been drinking again?"
"03","24","24","SANDY","What are you talking about?"
"03","24","24","SETH","Maybe if you paid attention to anything other than that stupid hospital, you'd notice Mom's been passing out before dinner."
"03","24","24","SANDY","Don't talk to your father like that."
"03","24","24","SETH","That would require you to act like my father."
"03","24","25","RYAN","All right, go ahead. I'll be waiting."
"03","24","26","RYAN","All right, let's go. Where is it?"
"03","24","26","RYAN","The car? You got to be kidding me."
"03","24","26","RYAN","No. No way, man. I'm not doing this."
"03","24","26","RYAN","Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!"
"03","24","26","RYAN","There's a patrol car up the street!"
"03","24","26","RYAN","They're coming! Let's go! What are you doing?!"
"03","24","26","RYAN","Let's go! Come on!"
"03","24","27","MARISSA","You guys better get that back to the headmistress' office before someone sees it here."
"03","24","27","KAITLIN","Oh, yeah. We will. And thanks again. That was pretty cool."
"03","24","27","MARISSA","Right. Well, I'm glad you guys aren't going to get in trouble. I actually kind of had fun."
"03","24","27","KAITLIN","Wow. I suspected as much, but it's actually kind of nice to hear you say it out loud. I think we're having a moment?"
"03","24","27","KAITLIN","Yeah, I liked hanging out, too. It sucks you're going to go to college next year."
"03","24","27","MARISSA","Um... We'll see about that."
"03","24","27","KAITLIN","Oh. Well, whatever you decide, I will miss you. And I mean it this time."
"03","24","27","MARISSA","Oh, me, too."
"03","24","28","KIRSTEN","I'm sorry I'm late. I'll... I'll hurry."
"03","24","28","SANDY","Hey, have a seat. So... Have you been drinking again? No explanation, no... no judgment. I just want to know. Oh, I wish you'd talk to me."
"03","24","28","KIRSTEN","I tried."
"03","24","28","SANDY","That night you called? I wish I had known."
"03","24","28","KIRSTEN","Then you would have come? Because the only thing that would actually get you to talk to me was the threat of a relapse?"
"03","24","28","SANDY","I hope you know that's not true."
"03","24","28","KIRSTEN","I don't know that. Oh, Sandy, I'm sorry. For everything. Especially the relapse. And, more importantly, for keeping it a secret."
"03","24","28","SANDY","I'm sorry, too."
"03","24","29","KIRSTEN","I know you know about my drinking."
"03","24","29","SETH","And I assume you know about Brown? Sorry to rat you out to Dad. It was kind of a heat-of-the-moment thing."
"03","24","29","KIRSTEN","I'm glad you did. I know things have been difficult, but we're still a family."
"03","24","29","KIRSTEN","I haven't given up on us, and neither has your father."
"03","24","29","SETH","My God! Apologize for that guy. I don't even want to be in the same room as him."
"03","24","29","KIRSTEN","I'm asking you to."
"03","24","29","SETH","I attend his Man of the Year party? Don't you think that's a hypocritical way to start the Cohen family clean slate?"
"03","24","29","KIRSTEN","Will you do it for me?"
"03","24","29","SETH","Fine. But I want my own table, and my applause for his speech will be so tepid."
"03","24","29","KIRSTEN","Thank you. Will you stop by the Newport Group? There's a concept drawing for the hospital that your father needs for his presentation. I'd ask Ryan, but he said he'd be late. I believe your father is going to fix this."
"03","24","29","SETH","That makes one of us."
"03","24","30","MARISSA","Ryan."
"03","24","30","RYAN","Hi. Hey, where are you right now?"
"03","24","30","MARISSA","I'm driving back from Montecito. Are you okay?"
"03","24","30","RYAN","Yeah. Can you, uh... Can you meet me at your place?"
"03","24","30","MARISSA","Yeah. Sure. There's a key under the mat by the pool. Just let yourself in, and wait in my room. I'll be there as soon as I can."
"03","24","30","RYAN","Thanks."
"03","24","30","MARISSA","Hey, Ryan..."
"03","24","30","RYAN","I... It's okay. It's okay. Um... Thanks."
"03","24","31","JULIE","Neil, why aren't you ready for the party? We should be leaving."
"03","24","31","JULIE","All the more reason to be there for him and Kirsten."
"03","24","31","JULIE","Well, I don't. The Cohens are like family, Neil."
"03","24","31","JULIE","Hmm. Well, I don't know about you, but I support the people I care about. I don't judge them. I'll call a cab."
"03","24","32","SETH","Hello."
"03","24","32","KIRSTEN","Hey. I was wondering if you have an ETA. Your father's about to take the stage."
"03","24","32","SETH","I'll be right there."
"03","24","32","KIRSTEN","Did you get the drawing? Okay. I'll see you soon."
"03","24","33","SANDY","Well, you're very sweet to say that, thank you."
"03","24","33","KIRSTEN","Excuse me. Can I borrow my husband for a moment?"
"03","24","33","SANDY","Excuse me."
"03","24","33","KIRSTEN","Isn't that Greg Otis?"
"03","24","33","SANDY","Oh, maybe he's here to arrest me. Wouldn't be the first time somebody left a Newport party in handcuffs. I'm going to go practice my speech anyway."
"03","24","34","MARISSA","Hey, what's going on?"
"03","24","34","RYAN","I was with you tonight. If anyone asks, can you say that?"
"03","24","34","MARISSA","Ryan..."
"03","24","34","RYAN","Just yes or no? Will you do it?"
"03","24","34","MARISSA","Yeah, of course."
"03","24","35","JULIE","You changed your mind?"
"03","24","35","JULIE","I'd like to think so."
"03","24","35","SANDY","Good evening, everyone. And thank you so much for coming out tonight, and thanks to Riviera Magazine for bestowing upon me this... this wonderful honor that I... I cannot accept. I used to think I was better than this place. You know, I came from outside the bubble, so I thought I was fit to judge it. So when it came time for me to run the Newport Group, I wasn't worried at all about losing my way. But I learned that despite the wide streets and the sunny views, you take one wrong turn in this town, and you can end up totally lost. Oh, thank you, Seth. Thanks, Kirsten. This drawing is as close to fully realized as Newport Mercy will ever be, because in the next few months, I'm going to be cooperating with the District Attorney's investigation of Dr. Henry Griffin and the hospital he and I were going to build."
"03","24","35","SUMMER","I'm so sorry, Cohen."
"03","24","35","SETH","No, it's okay. I think it's for the best."
"03","24","35","SANDY","And you... are going to have quite a case. I'll be in touch."
"03","24","35","KIRSTEN","You were wonderful."
"03","24","35","SANDY","Thanks."
"03","24","35","SETH","I thought it was wordy in the middle, but I think the end was nice."
"03","24","35","SANDY","Yeah?"
"03","24","35","SANDY","Maybe I'm too late."
"03","24","36","RYAN","They're here for me."
"03","24","36","MARISSA","Well, it's a good thing you were with me all night then, right?"
"03","24","37","SANDY","Do not ask him any questions unless I'm present."
"03","24","37","SANDY","I'm his father."
"03","24","37","RYAN","What happened?"
"03","24","37","SANDY","There's been a fire at the Newport Group. They think Seth did it."
"03","25","0","SETH","Hi, man."
"03","25","0","RYAN","So, how'd it go?"
"03","25","0","SANDY","He denied everything. Stopped by the office, picked up the drawing and left."
"03","25","0","KIRSTEN","Well, that's a good thing, except you don't believe him."
"03","25","0","SETH","I didn't know what to say. It was an accident, I swear."
"03","25","0","RYAN","All right, so tell your dad."
"03","25","0","SANDY","Ordinarily, of course, I'd believe him, you know that, but in light of these revelations about his recent behavior, I don't know. I think he's hiding something."
"03","25","0","SETH","Dad, remember when I called you the worst father ever? Right after that, I swung by your place of work, I smoked a joint, I forgot to put it out, and now your office fits into an ashtray."
"03","25","0","SANDY","The security camera in the garage has him as the last person to leave."
"03","25","0","KIRSTEN","But if he's telling the truth and you accuse him of lying..."
"03","25","0","SANDY","Well, clearly I've disappointed him enough already. I don't need to give him any more ammo."
"03","25","0","SETH","Well, this is shaping up to be a hell of a graduation. I can't do hard time, Ryan."
"03","25","0","RYAN","Well, lying to Sandy Cohen, what's harder than that?"
"03","25","0","SETH","I'm going to go to the car and get my iPod, listen to sad, depressing music for a change."
"03","25","0","RYAN","Which car?"
"03","25","0","SETH","My mom's."
"03","25","0","RYAN","You know what, actually, I'll get it."
"03","25","0","SETH","It's okay. It's just in the garage."
"03","25","0","RYAN","Uh, no, it's not. I, uh, I parked on the street. I've been meaning to move it. I'll get it."
"03","25","1","RYAN","What are you doing here, man?"
"03","25","1","RYAN","Yeah, what about the cops?"
"03","25","1","RYAN","Yeah, well, have a nice trip."
"03","25","1","RYAN","I'm not gonna help you. I'm done helping you."
"03","25","1","RYAN","I got graduation. My family's coming in tomorrow."
"03","25","1","RYAN","You stole."
"03","25","2","SUMMER","Or your mom, when she gets here. I'm sure she'll be real proud. I can't believe in a couple of hours we're going to be on that stage in our cap and gowns."
"03","25","2","TAYLOR","Well, except for Seth, who may be in an orange jumpsuit."
"03","25","2","SUMMER","Taylor!"
"03","25","2","TAYLOR","Sorry, Summer. I'm just really nervous about my valedictorian speech."
"03","25","2","SUMMER","Well, look, it's not like Cohen got charged with anything. He didn't burn the entire building down. He just damaged a couple of offices."
"03","25","2","MARISSA","You know, it sounds like you're talking about Ryan."
"03","25","2","TAYLOR","Sounds like the smoldering passion we unleashed in Seth needed an outlet."
"03","25","2","SUMMER","Think again, Taylor. I don't think Cohen's the one that needs to get laid."
"03","25","2","TAYLOR","Au contraire, Summer. Have I told you about my after, after prom party with Sung Ho and Yung Nam? It was hot and spicy and let's just say I had my very own Korean barbecue. Bibimbap."
"03","25","2","MARISSA","Wow."
"03","25","2","SUMMER","I'm so off kimchi."
"03","25","2","JULIE","Marissa."
"03","25","2","MARISSA","Hey, Mom. Isn't it a bit early to be saving seats?"
"03","25","2","JULIE","I brought you something. It's from Dad. A gift, maybe. Clearly he wanted you to have it for graduation. I just thought you might want it right away."
"03","25","2","MARISSA","Yeah. Yeah, thanks."
"03","25","2","JULIE","Okay. I'll see you in a bit. Bye, girls."
"03","25","2","SUMMER","Bye."
"03","25","2","TAYLOR","Bye."
"03","25","2","SUMMER","That was nice of him to think of you."
"03","25","2","MARISSA","Yeah. I'm gonna..."
"03","25","3","KIRSTEN","Dawn."
"03","25","3","KIRSTEN","Come on in."
"03","25","3","KIRSTEN","Give me your bags."
"03","25","3","KIRSTEN","It seems that way."
"03","25","3","RYAN","Hey, Mom."
"03","25","3","RYAN","How are you doing? I'm glad you could make it."
"03","25","4","KAITLIN","Gracias, Mima."
"03","25","4","KAITLIN","Dr. Roberts."
"03","25","4","KAITLIN","Well, you know, since my grades went from B's to A's, I was actually wondering if you could change my A's to B's."
"03","25","4","KAITLIN","Dude, I'm totally kidding."
"03","25","4","KAITLIN","I just love graduations. I thought I might stop by."
"03","25","4","JULIE","Kaitlin? Sweetie, hi."
"03","25","4","KAITLIN","Hi."
"03","25","4","JULIE","Is everything okay?"
"03","25","4","KAITLIN","Totally. I figured it was a safe bet, you know, Dad wouldn't come here.So I thought maybe you'd have an extra seat."
"03","25","4","JULIE","Yeah, great, okay."
"03","25","4","KAITLIN","All right, well, I'm just going to go to the hot tub, because I am so stressed out, finals, you know."
"03","25","4","JULIE","Okay."
"03","25","4","JULIE","Yeah. Really nice."
"03","25","5","SETH","Father."
"03","25","5","SANDY","Son."
"03","25","5","SETH","Uh... I just wanted to make sure you had the camera charged for graduation."
"03","25","5","SANDY","I do. Although, you're going to have to explain to your nana the whole Ofoto concept. She's not so good with the Internet."
"03","25","5","SETH","Sure. And when they announce my name, uh, could you... not do that cheer you did for me when I won Capture The Flag at Parents' Weekend? Which cheer was that?"
"03","25","5","SANDY","Oh. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Check out my boy, Cohen. Can you believe how he's growin'? The competition away he's blowin'..."
"03","25","5","SETH","That's the one. Please, don't do that. Ever."
"03","25","5","SANDY","Despite everything, we're still very proud of you."
"03","25","5","SETH","Yeah. Damn it. Why does Sandy Cohen have to be the best father ever?"
"03","25","5","SANDY","This is too hard."
"03","25","5","SETH","Um, Dad, I smoked a joint. I forgot to put it out. That's what started the fire."
"03","25","5","SANDY","Well, I appreciate you coming clean. But what I can't forgive is... is all the lying."
"03","25","5","SETH","Yeah, I know."
"03","25","5","SANDY","You smoked dope, you didn't tell me the truth about Brown, and that you couldn't come to me."
"03","25","5","SETH","I was embarrassed."
"03","25","5","SANDY","What? We're your parents. You know, we specialize in embarrassing you."
"03","25","5","SETH","Yeah, I know. But I felt like I couldn't really talk to you, though. I tried to, a couple of times, but you're always so busy with work and I was afraid of upsetting Mom."
"03","25","5","SANDY","I understand that, and I'm sorry. Well, we both screwed up."
"03","25","5","SETH","We're both usually so awesome."
"03","25","5","SANDY","Well, this is still very serious, isn't it? A couple hundred of thousands of dollars worth of damage, and there's a few offices that have to be rebuilt, and I still need to speak to the police."
"03","25","5","SETH","Yeah, yeah, I figured."
"03","25","5","SANDY","But you know what? I don't want any of that standing in the way today. Because your mother and I have been looking forward to this moment for... forever."
"03","25","5","SETH","No cheer?"
"03","25","5","SANDY","No cheer. How about a hug?"
"03","25","5","SETH","Sure. Thanks, Dad."
"03","25","5","SANDY","I love you, kid."
"03","25","5","SETH","I can't say ""I love you"" to another man. But I have much affection for you, as well."
"03","25","6","SUMMER","Hey."
"03","25","6","MARISSA","Hey."
"03","25","6","SUMMER","Everything okay?"
"03","25","6","MARISSA","Can you sit?"
"03","25","6","SUMMER","Okay. Well, how's your dad?"
"03","25","6","MARISSA","Really good, actually. He's not getting beat up by anyone right now, and he's not in charge of anyone's money, so..."
"03","25","6","SUMMER","That's good."
"03","25","6","MARISSA","He's actually sailing really, really nice boats for rich people."
"03","25","6","SUMMER","Sounds like fun."
"03","25","6","MARISSA","I know, that's what I thought."
"03","25","6","SUMMER","Oh, you want to, like, rent a yacht? We totally should."
"03","25","6","MARISSA","More like work on one. See, my dad is captain of this yacht that's sailing to the Greek Islands, and he says they need extra crew members. So he asked me if I wanted to go."
"03","25","6","SUMMER","You don't know how to sail boats."
"03","25","6","MARISSA","This would be more like, you know, peeling potatoes, washing dishes."
"03","25","6","SUMMER","Oh, yes, much more in your area of expertise."
"03","25","6","MARISSA","Yeah, but it's just for a year."
"03","25","6","SUMMER","What about college?"
"03","25","6","MARISSA","What about college? I'm not meant for college. Not now, anyway. You guys are all leaving, I'm going to be stuck here alone. I need a new life. I need a change."
"03","25","6","SUMMER","Well, scrubbing decks would definitely be a change."
"03","25","6","MARISSA","Then it's kind of the perfect graduation present. And you know, this way, I can hang out with my dad. He seems to have turned it around."
"03","25","6","SUMMER","When would you leave?"
"03","25","6","MARISSA","Well... that's the only thing. The boat is supposed to leave Hawaii middle of the week, so I'd have to fly out tomorrow night. My dad also kind of included the plane ticket."
"03","25","6","SUMMER","If you promise to sail up to Rhode Island, I'm in. I love you."
"03","25","6","MARISSA","Love you, too."
"03","25","8","SETH","This is it, dude. Never going to have to step foot in this stupid school or this stupid student lounge again."
"03","25","8","RYAN","Nostalgic already, huh?"
"03","25","8","SETH","Never going to have to see any of these shoe-peeing, shallow, water polo playing..."
"03","25","8","SETH","It's a graduation gown; you're wearing one, too."
"03","25","8","SUMMER","Hey. You guys look so cute. Is everything okay at home?"
"03","25","8","SETH","Sandy Cohen and I got a little man-boy love going."
"03","25","8","MARISSA","Hey."
"03","25","8","RYAN","Hey."
"03","25","8","MARISSA","Ryan, can I talk to you for a sec?"
"03","25","8","RYAN","Sure, yeah."
"03","25","9","MARISSA","So what do you think? You think it's the stupidest idea ever, right?"
"03","25","9","RYAN","No, I, uh, it sounds great. It's what you need."
"03","25","9","MARISSA","That means a lot to me. You know, who would have thought you'd be going to college?"
"03","25","9","RYAN","And you'd be doing manual labor. Well, everyone's doing exactly what they need to."
"03","25","9","MARISSA","Yeah."
"03","25","9","RYAN","Hey, um, this is going to sound weird, but can I drive you to the airport? I mean, you were the first person I met here. I'd kind of like to be the last person to say good-bye."
"03","25","9","MARISSA","You know, it's funny. I was going to ask you the same thing."
"03","25","10","RYAN","Hey. Let's go graduate. Come on, come on!"
"03","25","11","TAYLOR","They say there's no one older than a high school senior, but no one younger than a college freshman. Well, I guess now we'll find out as we begin our journey."
"03","25","11","TAYLOR","But as Cicero said... ""I hope the memory of our friendship will be everlasting."""
"03","25","11","SANDY","All right, Sethie!"
"03","25","11","SUMMER","Yeah!"
"03","25","11","TAYLOR","And just because we're leaving Harbor, does not mean that our learning is done. ""We must learn as long as we may live."""
"03","25","11","TAYLOR","But if I could leave you all with one final word of advice... ""Don't let the bastards get you down."" Thank you."
"03","25","11","SANDY","Hey, come on back in. Come on, let's get together."
"03","25","12","SANDY","There's no such thing as a little racist. Excuse me, forgive me, but I'm a very proud father, and I, I want to say a few words. I think I can speak for Kirsten and the other parents here tonight when I tell you kids how thrilled we are to share this wonderful touchstone with you. I know the last few years have been... There's been tragedy and comedy and first loves and broken hearts and family members lost and found. It hasn't all been perfect, but we're all family here. So, cheers."
"03","25","12","SETH","Hey, the speech wasn't that moving."
"03","25","12","SUMMER","No, it's just so sad, you know. I mean, it's all over. No more Harbor. Atwood's going to Berkeley, Marissa's sailing around the world. I'm going to Rhode Island."
"03","25","12","SETH","Well, I'll be there, too."
"03","25","12","SUMMER","We don't know that yet. We haven't heard from RISD."
"03","25","12","SETH","Whatever happens, you know, we'll make it work."
"03","25","12","SUMMER","We will?"
"03","25","12","SETH","Yeah, of course."
"03","25","12","SUMMER","Sweet."
"03","25","12","SETH","Are you going to do this all summer?"
"03","25","13","MARISSA","Hey. Um, can I talk to you?"
"03","25","13","JULIE","Yes, of course. Oh! I have to give you your graduation gift. Honey, what's wrong?"
"03","25","13","MARISSA","I kind of have some big news."
"03","25","13","JULIE","Sweetie, I know."
"03","25","13","MARISSA","You know?"
"03","25","13","JULIE","Your father called me last week, ran the idea by me, wanted to know what I thought."
"03","25","13","MARISSA","And what do you think?"
"03","25","13","JULIE","I think that I will miss you terribly and that if you really want to leave, I need to let you go."
"03","25","13","KAITLIN","I knew about it, too."
"03","25","13","MARISSA","You did?"
"03","25","13","JULIE","You did?"
"03","25","13","KAITLIN","Mm-hmm. Dad, he called me. Threw the idea by me, asked my opinion and also told me that you might need another daughter to worry about. So that's why I decided to come home... for good."
"03","25","13","JULIE","Oh, my God. Cooper family hug, come on. Mom. Come on."
"03","25","13","KAITLIN","Okay."
"03","25","13","JULIE","Oh, your gift, here. Don't know how much good it'll be on a boat."
"03","25","13","MARISSA","Oh, Mom, it's beautiful."
"03","25","13","JULIE","Maybe you'll get attacked by pirates. You can barter it."
"03","25","14","RYAN","So where are we going, huh?"
"03","25","14","RYAN","I trust you, but... What? You got me a car? You got me a car? You got me a car?!"
"03","25","14","RYAN","I love it... I love it. Are you kidding? How did you..."
"03","25","14","RYAN","Car and bow-- amazing. I-I don't know what to say."
"03","25","14","RYAN","Sure. Yeah."
"03","25","14","RYAN","Okay."
"03","25","15","SUMMER","And... Here."
"03","25","15","TAYLOR","Hi, guys."
"03","25","15","SUMMER","Hey."
"03","25","15","TAYLOR","So I just stopped by to say farewell."
"03","25","15","SUMMER","You're leaving for the Sorbonne already?"
"03","25","15","TAYLOR","Oh, no, not quite. Sung Ho and I decided to spend the summer in his family's village. We're defusing land mines in the DMZ."
"03","25","15","SETH","That's the way to spend your summer vacation."
"03","25","15","TAYLOR","As a gift to the Class of 2006. So my work here is done. It has been a pleasure being second-circle corps."
"03","25","15","SETH","I think you can join the inner circle."
"03","25","15","TAYLOR","I can? Oh, my God. The Fab Five!"
"03","25","15","SUMMER","I'm so happy and so sad."
"03","25","15","TAYLOR","I know, me, too!"
"03","25","15","SETH","This is awkward. I was sort of kidding about that inner circle thing."
"03","25","16","MARISSA","Hello?"
"03","25","16","MARISSA","Why are you calling me?"
"03","25","16","MARISSA","Oh, yeah? Well, I've got a plan, too. It's called never seeing you again."
"03","25","16","MARISSA","Don't threaten me... or Ryan."
"03","25","17","SUMMER","This is cool."
"03","25","17","RYAN","Yeah, yeah, it's a gift from my mom."
"03","25","17","MARISSA","Oh, yeah? So it's not the one you stole? Volchok called me."
"03","25","17","RYAN","Look, the whole thing is..."
"03","25","17","MARISSA","Complicated? What does he want? Money to get out of town. And do you have this money?"
"03","25","17","RYAN","Not yet, but..."
"03","25","17","MARISSA","Then let me help you."
"03","25","17","RYAN","No, it's all right, I got it."
"03","25","17","MARISSA","Ryan, I brought Volchok on us. It's only fair I help get rid of him. Come on, we're in this together, okay? One last time."
"03","25","17","RYAN","One last time."
"03","25","18","KIRSTEN","You're welcome."
"03","25","18","SANDY","Here, here, here, for the cab."
"03","25","18","SANDY","Oh, come on."
"03","25","18","SANDY","All right."
"03","25","18","SANDY","Thank you."
"03","25","18","RYAN","Okay."
"03","25","18","SANDY","Good to see you."
"03","25","18","RYAN","My turn."
"03","25","18","RYAN","Okay."
"03","25","18","RYAN","Why don't we just not say good-bye? How about, see you soon?"
"03","25","18","RYAN","See you soon?"
"03","25","18","RYAN","All right."
"03","25","18","RYAN","I love you, too."
"03","25","18","SETH","Good to see you, too. It means a lot that you made it down. I was being sincere."
"03","25","18","RYAN","And thanks again for the car."
"03","25","18","SETH","Ryan got a car? Really? I been waiting three years for a car. I'm supposed to be the spoiled one."
"03","25","18","RYAN","All right. Bye."
"03","25","19","JULIE","Hey, Marissa, easy on the bass. Oh. Kaitlin. What are you doing? Where's your sister?"
"03","25","19","KAITLIN","Oh, Marissa went to go rendez-vous with Ryan."
"03","25","19","JULIE","And you thought you'd do some renovations for her?"
"03","25","19","KAITLIN","Well, yeah, she said I could have her room."
"03","25","19","JULIE","And there's some paint chips in the kitchen if you want to go look. Oh, is this going to be a permanent fixture?"
"03","25","19","KAITLIN","Well, I worked really hard on that. It seems like you and Marissa are on good terms now."
"03","25","19","JULIE","Yeah, figures."
"03","25","19","KAITLIN","Just as she's about to set sail. It's pretty cool that you're letting her go."
"03","25","19","JULIE","It's pretty cool that you came back so she can leave."
"03","25","19","KAITLIN","Well, I don't love Marissa that much. It's just, all the older kids, they just see me as Marissa's little sister, and they've graduated. And now I can rule Harbor."
"03","25","20","MARISSA","Hey. Your mom left, huh? It went well?"
"03","25","20","RYAN","Yeah, really well."
"03","25","20","MARISSA","Well, now we get this out of the way, we'll have nothing left to worry about."
"03","25","20","RYAN","Mm, nah, I won't know what to do with myself."
"03","25","20","MARISSA","Oh, I'm sure you'll figure it out."
"03","25","20","RYAN","You sure your mom's not going to be too offended?"
"03","25","20","MARISSA","Well, I feel bad, but she did say I could use it to barter with pirates. This seems to fit the bill."
"03","25","20","RYAN","Yeah, definitely."
"03","25","20","MARISSA","So I'll navigate us to the pawn shop."
"03","25","20","RYAN","No, I'll go. Just give me the directions."
"03","25","20","MARISSA","Hey, I thought we decided I was coming along. I'm going to handle this myself."
"03","25","20","RYAN","Okay, if you come, you're staying in the car."
"03","25","20","MARISSA","Aww, you know what?"
"03","25","20","RYAN","What?"
"03","25","20","MARISSA","I'm really going to miss you bossing me around."
"03","25","20","RYAN","You'll get used to it."
"03","25","20","MARISSA","Nope, nope."
"03","25","20","RYAN","Yes, you will."
"03","25","20","MARISSA","For the rest of my life, I'm just gonna be sad about it."
"03","25","21","SANDY","Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry."
"03","25","21","SANDY","No, no, I'm just passing through."
"03","25","21","SANDY","My reputation proceeds me?"
"03","25","21","SANDY","I see that it does."
"03","25","21","SANDY","Nice to meet you."
"03","25","21","SANDY","Defend the poor, sing the classics. I had a reputation and a routine."
"03","25","21","SANDY","Oh, for a minute, then I went into the private sector, into big business."
"03","25","21","SANDY","Believe it or not, working here were the best days of my life."
"03","25","21","SANDY","Greg."
"03","25","21","SANDY","Thanks for meeting me here on neutral ground."
"03","25","21","SANDY","Yeah. Spitz."
"03","25","21","SANDY","Hey, what are they asking for? Come on, with a B&E with no priors? You've got to be kidding me."
"03","25","22","SETH","Come in."
"03","25","22","KIRSTEN","Hey. What are you doing?"
"03","25","22","SETH","In my third month on this book. I'm hoping to have it finished by fall."
"03","25","22","KIRSTEN","It's hard to believe you're done with school. You're not a kid anymore."
"03","25","22","SETH","Well, let's be honest, I was never very kid-like."
"03","25","22","KIRSTEN","You always were an old soul."
"03","25","22","SETH","Mom, I want you to know..."
"03","25","22","KIRSTEN","You don't have to apologize. I think that fire was the best thing that could have happened."
"03","25","22","SETH","Well, then, I did it on purpose."
"03","25","22","KIRSTEN","Your father's talking to the lawyers, and hopefully, you'll be free and clear."
"03","25","22","SETH","Okay, good. I just have to wait and hear from RISD."
"03","25","22","KIRSTEN","Speaking of which, I think there's some mail that you might be interested in."
"03","25","23","RYAN","Again, I think the pearls would have looked good on you."
"03","25","23","RYAN","Yep. Maybe you can use it to start over."
"03","25","23","RYAN","Whatever, man. We're done."
"03","25","23","RYAN","Send her a postcard."
"03","25","23","RYAN","Drive, drive. Let's go. Lets' go!"
"03","25","24","JULIE","Hey, honey. So I guess this is it, huh?"
"03","25","24","MARISSA","Yeah. I guess so."
"03","25","24","JULIE","Marissa, I just want you to know that everything I ever did- good, bad or otherwise-- I did it for you. So that you could have a better life than I had. And I know I wasn't perfect. I mean, the thing with Luke, and trying to frame Ryan for attempted homicide..."
"03","25","24","MARISSA","Mom. I love you. Okay, just know that."
"03","25","24","JULIE","Oh, sweetheart, that's all I wanted. I love you, too."
"03","25","24","MARISSA","Besides, you know the strength it takes to start over? To go out on my own? That has to come from being Julie Cooper's daughter."
"03","25","24","JULIE","I am spirited, aren't I?"
"03","25","24","MARISSA","Yeah."
"03","25","24","KAITLIN","Hey. Ryan and Seth are here."
"03","25","24","MARISSA","All right, um... I guess I better go. You've got to promise to keep things interesting for Mom next year, okay?"
"03","25","24","KAITLIN","Oh, that won't be a problem."
"03","25","24","JULIE","Wait. One more Cooper family hug."
"03","25","25","MARISSA","Coop, do you know where this party is? I think it's in the flower streets, but it could be in the number streets."
"03","25","25","SUMMER","I'll check the e-vite."
"03","25","25","SETH","May I ask a question? Why are we going to another lame Harbor party?"
"03","25","25","RYAN","Yeah, it is Marissa's last night in town."
"03","25","25","SUMMER","Yeah. We always wind up just talking to each other."
"03","25","25","RYAN","All right, so, uh, Bait Shop, uh, diner..."
"03","25","25","MARISSA","Wait, I know somewhere where we could go. But you'll have to follow in your car."
"03","25","26","SANDY","It's a little something, just because I love you."
"03","25","26","KIRSTEN","Uh-oh. Flowers usually means bad news."
"03","25","26","SANDY","Oh, ye of little faith. No, I spoke to the DA, came clean about the accident, and since we're not gonna press charges, the whole thing will blow over."
"03","25","26","KIRSTEN","And then it's back to the Newport Group, business as usual?"
"03","25","26","SANDY","Well... how about not? I went back to my old office, the place looked worse than ever. The guy in there was beaten down, exhausted... Oh, it was a thing of beauty."
"03","25","26","KIRSTEN","You want to go back."
"03","25","26","SANDY","Where are the kids?"
"03","25","26","MARISSA","At some party. And then Ryan's taking Marissa to the airport."
"03","25","26","SANDY","Oh. So this is what it'll be like all next year, huh? Empty nest."
"03","25","26","KIRSTEN","What does one do in an empty nest?"
"03","25","26","SANDY","Oh, I have a few ideas."
"03","25","27","RYAN","Okay, this, uh, this looks familiar."
"03","25","27","MARISSA","Yeah? Well, it shouldn't. They rebuilt it completely after you burnt it down."
"03","25","27","SETH","Model home."
"03","25","27","MARISSA","Yep. It's for sale. And it's completely deserted."
"03","25","28","SUMMER","You guys ever wonder what life would be like if Atwood never came here?"
"03","25","28","MARISSA","I definitely never would have talked to Seth."
"03","25","28","SUMMER","Oh, hell, no. Me, either."
"03","25","28","RYAN","See? You owe me one, buddy."
"03","25","28","SETH","Me? She'd still be dating a dude who shaves his chest."
"03","25","28","SUMMER","I can't believe that for a minute I was actually interested in Atwood. No offense."
"03","25","28","RYAN","None taken, biatch."
"03","25","28","MARISSA","It was only until you found out he was from Chino."
"03","25","28","SUMMER","Exactly."
"03","25","28","RYAN","You actually invited me to Holly's Beach House."
"03","25","28","SUMMER","Oh, my God."
"03","25","28","SETH","You said she invited me. I'm not faring well on this trip down memory lane."
"03","25","28","MARISSA","Well, as fun as it usually is making fun of Seth, I think it's time I should go."
"03","25","28","SETH","Aw, here come the waterworks."
"03","25","28","SUMMER","I can't believe that I'm saying bye to you."
"03","25","28","MARISSA","I know."
"03","25","28","SUMMER","I love you so much."
"03","25","28","MARISSA","I love you, too."
"03","25","28","SUMMER","You're my best friend forever, okay? And if you wind up hooking up with some hot Greek shipping heir, I'm so your maid of honor."
"03","25","28","MARISSA","I know. See ya."
"03","25","28","SETH","All right, see you later."
"03","25","28","SUMMER","You guys, hug."
"03","25","28","SETH","All right."
"03","25","28","MARISSA","Bye. I've got to get changed."
"03","25","28","RYAN","All right, see you in a while."
"03","25","28","SUMMER","Okay."
"03","25","29","RYAN","You okay?"
"03","25","29","MARISSA","Yeah."
"03","25","29","RYAN","It's so weird talking about that night. Last time we were here, I was leaving, and now you are."
"03","25","29","MARISSA","That night... did you ever think we'd end up together?"
"03","25","29","RYAN","You saying it's over? You never know. Right?"
"03","25","29","MARISSA","I'm sorry... for all the craziness."
"03","25","29","RYAN","I wouldn't have done it any differently. Except maybe Oliver."
"03","25","29","MARISSA","Me, too."
"03","25","31","SUMMER","Whoa, what is this?"
"03","25","31","SETH","Your graduation present."
"03","25","31","SUMMER","Oh, my God, it's a 60-inch high-def flat screen."
"03","25","31","SETH","Uh, maybe..."
"03","25","31","SUMMER","It's empty."
"03","25","31","SETH","No, it's not."
"03","25","31","SUMMER","Ow. What is this? ""Dear Mr. Cohen, while your application arrived too late for our fall semester, we are happy to announce that your application has been approved."" You got in!"
"03","25","31","SETH","Yeah. I start in January. Let me just say again how sorry I am for messing up the college thing and lying to you and hurting you and you know..."
"03","25","31","SUMMER","Hey. Look, it's okay, 'cause everything happened the way it was supposed to."
"03","25","31","SETH","Well, then I did it on purpose."
"03","25","31","SUMMER","Okay. So I'll go to Rhode Island, and I'll get the lay of the land."
"03","25","31","SETH","Yeah, then we'll have Thanksgiving, Christmas, then we'll be together."
"03","25","31","SUMMER","I think I'm going to cry again."
"03","25","31","SETH","Uh, tears of joy?"
"03","25","31","SUMMER","Come on, thanks for letting me in your box."
"03","25","31","SETH","What are we doing?"
"03","25","32","RYAN","Are you, uh, you okay? You ready for this?"
"03","25","32","MARISSA","I have no idea. What about you? I mean, you're the one who's leaving the Cohens, doing the college thing."
"03","25","32","RYAN","I'm terrified."
"03","25","32","MARISSA","Me, too."
"03","25","32","RYAN","So if you ever want to talk or email, if they have that... I don't how boats work, you know..."
"03","25","32","MARISSA","I'll find a way to stay in touch. What's that?"
"03","25","32","RYAN","It's this guy; he's been following me. Go ahead, go ahead, pass! What is he doing?"
"03","25","32","MARISSA","What the hell?"
"03","25","32","RYAN","All right, hold on."
"03","25","32","MARISSA","Whoa! Oh, my God, it's him. What are you doing?! Oh, my God! Okay, pull over!"
"03","25","32","RYAN","Where?!"
"03","25","32","MARISSA","Stop! What the hell are you doing?!"
"03","25","32","MARISSA","Get away, okay! You're gonna make us crash!"
"03","25","32","MARISSA","Ryan, look out!"
"03","25","33","RYAN","Marissa. Marissa. Marissa. Marissa. Marissa. Marissa."
"03","25","33","MARISSA","Ryan."
"03","25","33","RYAN","Okay. Okay. Okay, I'm going to get help, okay?"
"03","25","33","MARISSA","No, don't leave."
"03","25","33","RYAN","Yeah, yeah. I've got to get help."
"03","25","33","MARISSA","No. Stay. D-Don't leave."
"03","25","33","RYAN","Okay. Hold on. Hold on, okay? Okay? Hold on. Hold on. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay... Marissa. Marissa. Marissa."
"04","01","0","RYAN","Hello? Hi. Right now,no. Yeah. Yeah,okay. I'll be right there."
"04","01","1","SANDY","Is he here? Thank you.You've been very helpful. Hey,Ryan,you there? I just want to talk to you for a minute. Come on.We miss you! We're worried about you."
"04","01","2","JULIE","Hey,Kaitlin,why aren't you in school?"
"04","01","2","JULIE","Oh,that's nice. Well,I guess I'm going to get going."
"04","01","2","KAITLIN","Where are you going? You know you're not supposed to be driving at night anymore."
"04","01","2","JULIE","Great boots,baby."
"04","01","2","KAITLIN","Mom,maybe I should go with you."
"04","01","3","JULIE","Hey,Ryan. Come on in."
"04","01","4","SETH","So Friday morning,a little check-in before the weekend. I'm still here,kicking it Newport style. I can't believe I just said that. But,uh,yeah,things are good. Ryan's decision to defer college seems to be working out well. He's got a new place,new job,made some new friends. Sandy Cohen is doing what he does best,fighting the man,sticking up for the little guy."
"04","01","5","SANDY","I don't care if a plea helps the judge make his tee time. Listen,listen,I've got to go.My kid's here. All right."
"04","01","6","SETH","It's not toothpaste. Tell us another."
"04","01","8","SUMMER","Chafe,hey,um,what are we protesting?"
"04","01","8","SUMMER","Right,okay,just give me a sec."
"04","01","8","SUMMER","Then let's get out there."
"04","01","9","SETH","What? I'm sorry,maybe I didn't understand you correctly. Did you seriously just ask if there was a comic book based on the X-Men movie?"
"04","01","9","KIRSTEN","Hey,sweetheart. How's work?"
"04","01","9","SETH","Uh,I'm worried,Mom. I'm worried about the future of America. Leon."
"04","01","9","KIRSTEN","Hey,Leon. I brought some..."
"04","01","9","SETH","Another care package for Ryan?"
"04","01","9","SETH","I'm sure some Archie and Jughead will cheer him right up."
"04","01","9","KIRSTEN","Seth."
"04","01","9","SETH","I don't know what you're expecting,Mom.The guy's changed.I will take the care package over where'll it'll sit next to all the other ones he hasn't opened in the last five months."
"04","01","9","KIRSTEN","Why don't you invite him for dinner?"
"04","01","9","SETH","He didn't go to Marissa's funeral. You really think he wants to come over for family dinner at the Cohen's?"
"04","01","10","JULIE","Oh,hi. Am I making too much noise?"
"04","01","10","JULIE","I was surveying the yard this morning. I think Ernesto has gotten sloppy with these scrubs."
"04","01","10","JULIE","That's a good idea,honey."
"04","01","10","JULIE","Oh,I'm just so tired from all the yard work."
"04","01","10","JULIE","Okay... you hire the landscapers. I'm going to go plug in my glue gun and finish those sea grass placemats I started last night. Thanks,hon."
"04","01","10","KAITLIN","Thanks. You know,it's nothing personal. She ignores me,too. I'm starting to think it's a good thing."
"04","01","11","SETH","Ryan! Ryan!"
"04","01","11","RYAN","Seth,go away.I'm sleeping."
"04","01","11","SETH","You're sleeping? And you're talking? Ryan,I don't even see how that's possible unless you're talking in your sleep. Hey,look,you're awake."
"04","01","11","RYAN","Package from your mom.Thank you."
"04","01","11","SETH","Yeah. Aren't you going to invite me in? So the utility closet is the new pool house.Things change. It's the Seth Ryan time that counts."
"04","01","11","RYAN","I'm tired Seth.I work nights."
"04","01","11","SETH","Right,but you don't work tonight,I checked with your boss, which is why I'm inviting you to dinner with us. Just show up.Eat some food,let my parents see that you're still alive. It'd mean a lot to them,and it'd mean a lot to me."
"04","01","11","RYAN","Yeah,okay,sure,I'll see you tonight."
"04","01","11","SETH","Great. Hey,what are you doing? I was going to get some ice cream or something. Okay."
"04","01","12","SUMMER","Chicken lovers of the world,unite!"
"04","01","12","SUMMER","It is people like you keeping the chickens from flying free."
"04","01","12","SUMMER","Yeah. Thanks,Chafe. Hello."

"04","01","12","SUMMER","How's Paris?"
"04","01","12","TAYLOR","Incroyable. You know,being an expat totally suits me. Except that I miss you."
"04","01","12","SUMMER","You can only parlez so much Francais until you start to get a little nostalgic for the motherland."
"04","01","12","TAYLOR","Summer!"
"04","01","12","SUMMER","One sec,Taylor."
"04","01","12","SUMMER","Totally. Tell them to use the recycled paper. Taylor,you know what?I actually have to go."
"04","01","12","TAYLOR","Oh,pas un problème."
"04","01","12","SUMMER","Well,it was great to talk to you. Listen,don't be a stranger,and have a great time in Paris."
"04","01","12","TAYLOR","Vive la France,Summer. Vive la France!"
"04","01","13","TAYLOR","Can I get a little more coffee? Thank you."
"04","01","14","KIRSTEN","Okay,taste this and tell me if it's ready."
"04","01","14","SANDY","It's hot!"
"04","01","14","KIRSTEN","It is so hot! Did I overcook it?"
"04","01","14","SANDY","It is definitely not undercooked."
"04","01","14","SETH","Table's set for four.Actually feels kind of weird."
"04","01","14","SANDY","Well,things have been a little weird around here until lately. Tonight might not be any different. We shouldn't be expecting any miracles."
"04","01","14","SETH","No zippy one-liners?"
"04","01","14","KIRSTEN","Not a lot of smiles."
"04","01","14","SANDY","A few grunts.An occasional shrug."
"04","01","14","KIRSTEN","Yeah,it'll be just like old times. I'm looking forward to it. He'll be here any minute. So,ready or not,the pasta is coming off the stove."
"04","01","14","SANDY","Oh,stand back,son.She's ready to blow."
"04","01","14","SETH","'Cause it's hot,that's funny."
"04","01","15","RYAN","I wouldn't miss it."
"04","01","15","RYAN","No,no.Not tonight. What about him?"
"04","01","15","RYAN","No.I'm good."
"04","01","16","SANDY","Well,I thought dinner was excellent."
"04","01","16","KIRSTEN","Do you think anything happened to him?"
"04","01","16","SANDY","Ryan,it's Sandy again. The microwave still works,if you feel like dropping by. And,even if you don't,please call,huh? Let us know you're okay."
"04","01","16","KIRSTEN","Should we call the police? Hospitals?"
"04","01","16","SETH","No.Mom,he's fine. Well,he's not,you know,fine,but he's not coming."
"04","01","16","KIRSTEN","Well,even if Ryan didn't want to come,he would have called,Ryan always calls. Where are you going?"
"04","01","16","SANDY","I'm going to try and talk to him."
"04","01","16","SETH","No offense,Dad,but I don't think he is going to be in the mood for one of your pep talks right now, as inspiring and motivational as they usually are. I'll go."
"04","01","16","SANDY","Thanks for the compliment,however backhanded.Are you sure?"
"04","01","16","KIRSTEN","Do you want your father to go with you?"
"04","01","16","SETH","No,I got it."
"04","01","17","KAITLIN","They're just a bunch of rent-a-cops,and this shwag you guys gave me is barely pot anyway. We might as well be smoking dirt."
"04","01","17","KAITLIN","Yeah,just blame it on your lame dealer. But,if I don't get an ""A"" in chemistry,I have only you two to blame. So,less whining,more lab reporting. Oh,no."
"04","01","17","KAITLIN","No."
"04","01","17","KAITLIN","Gloria? Why does that sound familiar?"
"04","01","17","KAITLIN","So that's the step-monster?"
"04","01","18","SETH","I'm trying to hold it together here,but... I'm sorry I know you're doing the college thing,I know I'm supposed to give you space. Just,um... call when you can,okay? Bye."
"04","01","20","SUMMER","Okay,I'll just be there in a sec,okay?"
"04","01","20","SUMMER","Yeah. It's just,when I left to move out here,everything was kind of a mess at home."
"04","01","20","SUMMER","Right. Well,it's a little more than that. Everyone hasn't really moved on like I have. I think my friends need me."
"04","01","21","JULIE","Hello."
"04","01","21","JULIE","No.Help me. I was just trying to rearrange some furniture. I got some very helpful tips from HGTV."
"04","01","21","JULIE","I didn't know it was a built-in."
"04","01","21","KAITLIN","Mom,what are you doing? Rearranging the furniture? It's a built-in."
"04","01","21","JULIE","Yes,thank you."
"04","01","21","KAITLIN","Dr.Roberts wasn't there to help you?"
"04","01","21","JULIE","Yeah,Neil.Where have you been?"
"04","01","21","KAITLIN","Emergency tummy tuck. Thank God you were there to prevent a tragedy from occurring."
"04","01","21","JULIE","I have no feeling in my extremities."
"04","01","22","JULIE","Back off,Neil. I was almost just killed by your heinous furniture."
"04","01","23","RYAN","No,no. Keep it."
"04","01","23","SETH","Hey,man. I saw your little performance.This is very Fight Club. Of course,at the end of that movie,it turns out Edward Norton's insane."
"04","01","23","RYAN","Sorry I missed dinner."
"04","01","23","SETH","Well,not as sorry as my parents. You want to tell them about your new vocation,or should I?"
"04","01","23","RYAN","I'm not going to tell them about it,and neither are you. Sorry. Just forget it."
"04","01","23","SANDY","Well,I don't know.Sandy's got a really good memory."
"04","01","23","SETH","It's not going to be so easy for him to forget the kid he adopted, and my mom's still kind of fond of you,so..."
"04","01","23","RYAN","I'm doing you guys a favor staying away."
"04","01","23","SETH","You're doing us a favor? Face it,man.I bring trouble."
"04","01","23","RYAN","Trey,Volchok,you and your family- you're... you're better off without me."
"04","01","23","SETH","It's not true.It's not your fault. Any of it. I'm not going to go anywhere until you come with me."
"04","01","23","RYAN","Yeah? What are you going to do? You going to fight me?"
"04","01","23","SETH","Well,seeing as how you don't fight back..."
"04","01","23","RYAN","I just don't any more,okay?"
"04","01","24","KIRSTEN","Pancakes extra fluffy."
"04","01","24","SANDY","Bacon extra crispy."
"04","01","24","KIRSTEN","So start talking."
"04","01","24","SETH","If you think you can ply me with food... you're right,this bacon is delicious."
"04","01","24","SANDY","Thank you."
"04","01","24","SETH","But I already told you everything last night."
"04","01","24","KIRSTEN","Yes,you gave us the facts- he's working,he's busy,he forgot."
"04","01","24","SANDY","Yeah,but we're not buying it."
"04","01","24","SETH","That's what he said. What are you looking for from me?"
"04","01","24","SANDY","Reading between the lines."
"04","01","24","KIRSTEN","Subtext?"
"04","01","24","SANDY","How'd he look?"
"04","01","24","SETH","Uh,he's looked better. But he's looked worse. You know,he might have cut himself shaving or something,uh,had a few nicks here and there."
"04","01","24","KIRSTEN","He was bleeding?"
"04","01","24","SETH","The bleeding had stopped. You know,they actually have coffee at work,which is where I'm going. So thank you very much for breakfast,and if I hear of anything else I will let you know. And,you guys,probably best just to give him a little more time."
"04","01","24","KIRSTEN","How much more time until we can't reach him?"
"04","01","24","SANDY","I'm going to check in on Ryan right after work."
"04","01","25","SUMMER","Cohen! I was just looking for you."
"04","01","25","SETH","Summer,what are you doing here?"
"04","01","25","SUMMER","I got your message."
"04","01","25","SETH","Oh,I'm sorry,I didn't... mean for you to,uh..."
"04","01","25","SUMMER","It sounded like an emergency."
"04","01","25","SETH","Oh,uh... Yeah,no,it kind of is."
"04","01","25","SUMMER","Well,I'm here to help."
"04","01","25","SETH","I'm so glad you came home for me."
"04","01","25","SUMMER","And for Ryan."
"04","01","25","SETH","Yeah,no,that's what I meant."
"04","01","25","SUMMER","Right."
"04","01","26","KAITLIN","Yeah,with your manly grunts,how could you?"
"04","01","26","KAITLIN","They say s*x is a really good form of exercise, although I doubt you're getting any with my mother these days."
"04","01","26","KIRSTEN","Let's talk about your personal life with those other than my mother."
"04","01","26","KAITLIN","So yesterday when you said you were at work... do you always do your consults down by the beach? With a leggy blonde? One you used to be married to?"
"04","01","26","KAITLIN","I know. And that's why I was going to ask my mother to explain. Then I thought with everything that's happened to her,to us,I didn't want to upset her."
"04","01","26","KAITLIN","But then I was going to ask her another question. About these leather boots I saw down at the plaza. They're really cute,and really expensive.I'm a seven and a half."
"04","01","27","KIRSTEN","Hey,Brad,Eric."
"04","01","27","KIRSTEN","Hey,sweetheart,how's your mother?"
"04","01","27","KAITLIN","She's recovering from an unfortunate accident with a wall unit."
"04","01","27","KIRSTEN","I told her it was a built-in."
"04","01","27","KAITLIN","She's in her room if you want to go in. It's not like she'll know you're there anyway."
"04","01","28","SUMMER","$1,500 for a pair of boots? Do you know how many pencils I could buy Sudanese school children? Intro to Developing Nations,it's one of my favorite classes."
"04","01","28","SETH","Yeah,I can see that.It's very cool."
"04","01","28","SUMMER","Followed closely by Environmental Studies. Gosh,this is a non-renewable resource.I can't believe this place doesn't have a recycling program."
"04","01","28","SETH","You should call our local councilman."
"04","01","28","SUMMER","Good idea."
"04","01","28","SETH","I was being sarcastic."
"04","01","28","SUMMER","Oh,I don't do sarcasm anymore,I'm post-ironic."
"04","01","28","SETH","You mean earnest?"
"04","01","28","SUMMER","Hey,I'm not here to help the environment,okay? I'm here to help Ryan."
"04","01","28","SETH","Except he doesn't want our help right now, so why don't I take you home?You can drop off your bag."
"04","01","28","SUMMER","No.You know what ? I'm just going to meet my dad for dinner and then come right back here,so..."
"04","01","28","SETH","So you're not even going home?"
"04","01","28","SUMMER","No."
"04","01","28","SETH","Yes.Of course."
"04","01","28","SUMMER","I just don't know if we'll have time.I mean,we have a lot of work to do. 3,000 miles at 30,000 feet,I had a lot of time to think. Rally up your geek army. I have a plan."
"04","01","29","KIRSTEN","Julie,it's me."
"04","01","29","JULIE","Kirsten?"
"04","01","29","KIRSTEN","Yeah. Can I come in?"
"04","01","29","JULIE","Today's not a good day."
"04","01","29","KIRSTEN","I know. None of them are,but hiding in your room won't make it better."
"04","01","29","JULIE","Oh,thank God it's you. I was starting to think you'd forgotten about me."
"04","01","29","KIRSTEN","We can sit outside and talk. I'll make some tea."
"04","01","29","JULIE","Can I call you back? Kirsten,it's so thoughtful of you to stop by. But as you can see,everything's fine."
"04","01","29","KIRSTEN","But you said it wasn't a good day."
"04","01","29","JULIE","For visitors,because I'm so very busy. Thanks for stopping by,Keeks. Oh,love your top."
"04","01","30","SUMMER","Dad,I'm going to use the bathroom,then I'll find you."
"04","01","30","TAYLOR","Excuse me, excuse me, would you pls hurry up ! ""To go"" means ""to go,"" implying in a hurry. I mean,how long does it take to club a turkey?"
"04","01","30","SUMMER","Considering I have no money other than euros,yes."
"04","01","30","TAYLOR","Oh,my God. Summer."
"04","01","30","SUMMER","I just talked to you,you were in France."
"04","01","30","TAYLOR","And you were in Rhode Island. It's just amazing the way this world works."
"04","01","30","SUMMER","What are you doing back in Newport? Are you meeting your mom?"
"04","01","30","TAYLOR","My mom,no.My mom is in Cabo,she won't... be back for a few days. Oh,my God,my mom. You never saw me."
"04","01","31","JULIE","Ryan,it's Julie. Can we see each other really soon ? It's important."
"04","01","32","RYAN","What's this?"
"04","01","32","JULIE","It's why I needed to see you. You see,after it happened,I hired a private investigator to find out where he went. Volchok. And now I know. All the information is in this file. I'm not giving it to the cops. Jail's too good for him. I'm giving it to you. You're the only person who can understand how I feel. And you can do with it,with him,what you want."
"04","01","32","RYAN","I don't want it."
"04","01","32","JULIE","What?"
"04","01","32","RYAN","I don't care about him,I don't care about any of it,and I don't want to start."
"04","01","32","JULIE","That's a-That's a lie,Ryan. That's... I know you. Even if you didn't come to her funeral or never visit her grave,you still care."
"04","01","33","SUMMER","Get off,mouth breather."
"04","01","33","SETH","Summer,if you want to go home and shower,we can take it from here. No,we can't.I want to go home and shower."
"04","01","33","SUMMER","That's okay,I'll just take a little sponge bath in the ladies room."
"04","01","33","SETH","Really? Because you're normally pretty rigorously about your bathing."
"04","01","33","SUMMER","I'm going to go get Ryan."
"04","01","33","SETH","Yeah,okay,great,it's just,um,I mean,you haven't even been home yet. You don't want to drop off your bag or..."
"04","01","33","SUMMER","What's the point of going home ? If the polar ice caps keep melting at their current rate,all of Newport will be under water in ten years anyway."
"04","01","34","RYAN","Summer."
"04","01","34","SUMMER","Hey,Atwood."
"04","01","34","RYAN","If you came here to talk..."
"04","01","34","SUMMER","You're not talking. I got it. Great to see you,too. I really like what you've done with your whole face. So,I'm going to need you to come with me now."
"04","01","34","RYAN","Can't do it; got to work."
"04","01","34","SUMMER","Right. Running that germy rag across those filthy tables,it's really important stuff. Look,I just flew 3,000 miles..."
"04","01","34","RYAN","I didn't ask you to."
"04","01","34","SUMMER","No,Seth did. He's worried about you. So are the Cohens. I know you think that you're protecting them,but... you're not,you're just hurting them. Besides,Seth keeps leaving me these endless whiny messages. They're totally clogging up my voice mail. Ryan,come on,take a deep breath. Just let me do what I do best."
"04","01","34","RYAN","Which is what?"
"04","01","34","SUMMER","Giving orders. Just do what I say,Atwood,one last time."
"04","01","35","JULIE","What?"
"04","01","36","RYAN","So why are we going to the comic bookstore?"
"04","01","36","SUMMER","Because I said so and you agreed to do what I said,so..."
"04","01","36","RYAN","As I told Seth,I don't really want to...talk."
"04","01","36","SANDY","You don't have to talk. You don't even have to listen."
"04","01","36","KIRSTEN","All you have to do is read."
"04","01","36","SETH","Look,Leon,lights."
"04","01","36","RYAN","Wh-Wh-What's this? You made me a comic book?"
"04","01","36","SETH","This is no ordinary comic book,my friend. This is an origin story. Now you may never save the planet,but you did save us,so this is our story. Now,it's true when you showed up,I had a super power,but it was one I didn't want. Being invisible,not as much fun as it sounds. And the ice queen was surrounded by an impenetrable force field. And her silver cell phone was her only link to the outside world. The litigator strained to hold up the weight of the world so burdened with the problems of others that he couldn't see those of his own family. One day the litigator brought his work home with him. Only this time,his work looked strangely like a young Russell Crowe."
"04","01","36","RYAN","It's okay,Seth,I can read."
"04","01","37","SANDY","Well,here we are."
"04","01","37","RYAN","That's it."
"04","01","37","SANDY","Thanks for taking the time, letting us make fools of ourselves. It meant a lot to Seth. And to Kirsten. Not so much to me. I'm no softy."
"04","01","37","RYAN","No,I know."
"04","01","37","SANDY","You should probably get going. You're late."
"04","01","37","RYAN","I hope they don't fire me."
"04","01","37","SANDY","I bet they got great benefits,huh? Good dental? The accommodations ?"
"04","01","37","RYAN","Yeah,uh... yeah,actually,about that,I... If I,you know,ever wanted to,you know,once in a while... The,uh,the pool house is probably filled with boxes,right?"
"04","01","37","SANDY","It's exactly the way you left it. A little too empty if you ask me."
"04","01","37","RYAN","Well,it wouldn't take me too long to pack."
"04","01","37","SANDY","Kirsten's got some leftovers from last night."
"04","01","37","RYAN","Thanks. Thank you."
"04","01","37","SANDY","You know,at the risk of saying too much... being there with her when it happened, you're never going to get over it, but you'll get used to it. Just let yourself feel what you need to feel,even if if hurts."
"04","01","37","RYAN","Yeah,one step at a time,okay?"
"04","01","37","SANDY","Okay,I'm going to shut up now."
"04","01","37","RYAN","Like,uh,giving these guys some notice,packing my toothbrush."
"04","01","37","SANDY","Let me buy you a toothbrush."
"04","01","37","RYAN","You got it. See you at home."
"04","01","38","SETH","Well,it seems like Ryan really went for it."
"04","01","38","SUMMER","Seems like it."
"04","01","38","SETH","Yeah. I couldn't have done it without you."
"04","01","38","SUMMER","Yeah,totally,since it was my idea and I got him to show up."
"04","01","38","SETH","Sure,no,that's what I meant,so... thank you."
"04","01","38","SUMMER","Yeah. Why don't you go home and see if Ryan's there. You know,I really want to know what happened."
"04","01","38","SETH","Sure,okay. Another good idea. I'll call you."
"04","01","38","SUMMER","Okay."
"04","01","38","SETH","Tomorrow,you want to get breakfast at the diner like old times?"
"04","01","38","SUMMER","Sure."
"04","01","38","SETH","Okay."
"04","01","40","SUMMER","Hey,Cohen,it's me. I really hope Ryan was there when you got back, because I won't be. I totally forgot there's this protest against seal poachers and,um, Heather Mills McCartney is going to be there. I just want to see how she's doing,you know,with everything after the divorce and all,so... listen,I'm sorry,but,uh,Thanksgiving is only a few weeks away. So... okay.. I love you. Give a hoot,don't pollute.Bye."
"04","01","41","JULIE","I was wondering when you'd finally come here."
"04","01","41","RYAN","Thanks for meeting me."
"04","01","41","JULIE","I'm here every day."
"04","01","41","RYAN","You have it?"
"04","01","41","JULIE","If you don't mind me asking,what changed your mind?"
"04","01","41","RYAN","I just realized... I have to do this."
"04","02","0","JULIE","Hello?"
"04","02","0","RYAN","It's me, I'm leaving."
"04","02","0","JULIE","Do you need anything?"
"04","02","0","RYAN","No."
"04","02","1","SETH","So when does the plane land in Providence? Half an hour? Well, okay, but I need to talk to her now. Do you think you could maybe connect me to the pilot? I'm... Damn it."
"04","02","2","JULIE","It took the investigator six months to find Volchok. Ryan, this may be the only chance we get."
"04","02","2","RYAN","He's not going to get away. I'll call you later."
"04","02","3","SETH","Ryan, hey, you're up bright and early."
"04","02","3","RYAN","I'm late."
"04","02","3","RYAN","The gym. Oh."
"04","02","3","SETH","Could you drop me off at the store? There's a new Supergirl maquette coming in and I want to be there before Philip and Leon get their greasy paws on it."
"04","02","3","RYAN","Yeah, the gym's the other way, I'm sorry."
"04","02","3","SETH","I heard you on the phone."
"04","02","3","RYAN","You were spying on me?"
"04","02","3","SETH","I wasn't spying on you. I was calling Summer to find out why she left. What are you doing?"
"04","02","3","RYAN","It's none of your business."
"04","02","3","SETH","Listen, if you know where Volchok is, let's just call the police."
"04","02","3","RYAN","No, I'm not calling the police."
"04","02","3","SETH","I can't let you go."
"04","02","3","RYAN","It's not really your choice."
"04","02","3","SETH","So what? Then, you're just going to find Volchok and either kill him or get yourself killed? That's insane."
"04","02","3","RYAN","This conversation is over. What are you... what are you doing?"
"04","02","3","SETH","I'm coming with you. It's not like you're leaving me any choice."
"04","02","3","RYAN","I'm going to tell the cops. I just need to see him first."
"04","02","3","SETH","No offense, but, like, nobody believes that."
"04","02","3","RYAN","If I tell Sandy or the cops, they'll make me stay away. I need to be there when they arrest him. The only way for me to do that is if I'm there first."
"04","02","3","SETH","Okay, take me with you."
"04","02","3","RYAN","No."
"04","02","3","SETH","I won't get in the way. You know how stealth I can be. Why not? If that's really all you're going to do."
"04","02","3","RYAN","Okay. You have to do everything I say."
"04","02","3","SETH","All right, you're the boss. So where we going?"
"04","02","3","RYAN","Mexico."
"04","02","3","SETH","Perfect, I need Chiclets."
"04","02","4","SUMMER","Hey."
"04","02","4","SUMMER","Oh, um, I had to go home. It was kind of an emergency, but everything's okay now. It was just hard being there."
"04","02","4","SUMMER","No, not really. What's going on?"
"04","02","4","SUMMER","What? They can't do that."
"04","02","4","SUMMER","I mean, this tree was, was an acorn in the primordial miasma of America."
"04","02","4","SUMMER","So what's the plan?"
"04","02","4","SUMMER","Che, what's the actual plan?"
"04","02","4","SUMMER","Okay, well, why don't we just start with the tree-sit?"
"04","02","4","SUMMER","I love her."
"04","02","5","TAYLOR","Seth left you a message last night, but I accidentally erased it."
"04","02","5","SUMMER","Hey. Taylor? What are you doing in my bed?"
"04","02","5","TAYLOR","Do you want to get in? We could snuggle."
"04","02","5","SUMMER","No. Um, what are you doing here and why are you listening to my messages, Taylor?"
"04","02","5","TAYLOR","I don't suppose you have an espresso maker."
"04","02","5","SUMMER","What are you wearing?"
"04","02","5","TAYLOR","What? I always sleep in this."
"04","02","5","SUMMER","Okay, just put this on... immediately. Okay, now, will you tell me what's going on? First, you're in Newport when you're supposed to be in France. Then, your mom shows up and you run away and-- How did you get here before me? Do you have a secret twin? Because that would explain so much."
"04","02","5","TAYLOR","Okay, okay, sit down. I'm going to explain everything to you. So, um... Something... happened in France. Just something... huge. And, uh, I came back to tell my mom about it, and then, I just got really scared and, uh, I was completely lost, Summer. But then I realized that you... were the one person who would understand.Summer, I... Oh, my God. When was the last time you shaved your legs? It's like a forest, and-- Oh, my God, your toenails."
"04","02","5","SUMMER","Okay, yeah, I don't do that stuff anymore."
"04","02","5","TAYLOR","Obviously. You've got hobbit feet."
"04","02","5","SUMMER","Okay, um,... Taylor, I'm sorry; my dining card is on the desk. We will talk about this later, I promise, okay?"
"04","02","5","TAYLOR","Okay."
"04","02","6","JULIE","Is he the really short one? I'm, I'm sure she just thought he was a student."
"04","02","6","JULIE","Right, well, Dear Torres, Kaitlin tests in the top three percent of her class. She's a natural leader. Surely, this is just..."
"04","02","6","JULIE","Good. Things are good. I don't know what to say. Yes, things have been difficult, but we're doing our best. Neil works a lot. He actually just left this morning for a conference in Seattle. But he and Kaitlin are good friends and, and things are good."
"04","02","6","JULIE","I'm sorry, look, Kaitlin is 15 years old. If I don't find voodoo dolls of myself in her bedroom, I'm happy."
"04","02","6","JULIE","That's a great idea; I'll make sure she's there."
"04","02","6","JULIE","Excuse me?"
"04","02","7","KIRSTEN","That's exactly what I said."
"04","02","7","SANDY","And there was nothing else?"
"04","02","7","KIRSTEN","Nothing."
"04","02","7","SANDY","Angry? Nudfo? Chocolate love? Nude fo... Nudfo? Is that a word?"
"04","02","7","KIRSTEN","Not that I know of."
"04","02","7","SANDY","When did you find this?"
"04","02","7","KIRSTEN","Just now, when I went to see if the boys had anything to give to the clothing drive."
"04","02","7","SANDY","You tried calling them?"
"04","02","7","KIRSTEN","No answer."
"04","02","7","SANDY","You know what I think this is?"
"04","02","7","KIRSTEN","A coded message?"
"04","02","7","SANDY","Nothing. It's probably the name of a band. Seth wrote it ona piece of paper and put it in his pocket. Relax, sweetheart."
"04","02","7","SETH","Dad, it's me."
"04","02","7","SANDY","Hello."
"04","02","7","SETH","Did you get my note? I had to write it in code in case Ryan found it."
"04","02","7","SANDY","Right, the note."
"04","02","7","SETH","Yeah, he says he's not going to do anything to Volchok."
"04","02","7","SANDY","Wait, wait, what?"
"04","02","7","SETH","I thought you got the note."
"04","02","7","SANDY","No, no, no. I got the ""Angry Nudfo Chocolate Love"" note. I didn't get the one about Ryan following Volchok."
"04","02","7","KIRSTEN","What?"
"04","02","7","SETH","It's an anagram."
"04","02","7","SANDY","Oh, yeah? Well, since when is there a G in Ryan?"
"04","02","7","SETH","I was in a rush; I had to add a few letters so it made sense."
"04","02","7","SANDY","Well, you certainly succeeded 'cause this thing is about as clear as mud."
"04","02","7","KIRSTEN","""Ryan found Volchok."" Of course."
"04","02","7","SANDY","Where are you? Okay, don't freak out. Please say Newport."
"04","02","7","SETH","We're in Mexico."
"04","02","7","KIRSTEN","He didn't say Newport, did he?"
"04","02","7","SETH","We're at a gas station outside Ensenada, but Ryan promises he just wants to see Volchok."
"04","02","7","SANDY","I want you guys back here right now."
"04","02","7","SETH","No offense, Dad, but that may be a tad unrealistic."
"04","02","7","SANDY","Let me talk to Ryan."
"04","02","7","SETH","Yeah, I got to go; I'll call you later."
"04","02","7","SANDY","Seth!"
"04","02","8","SETH","Hey, I was just leaving Summer a message. You ready to, uh, ándale?"
"04","02","8","RYAN","What did you tell Sandy?"
"04","02","8","SETH","Uh... Ah."
"04","02","8","RYAN","Did you tell him about Volchok?"
"04","02","8","SETH","Yeah, I did, and honestly, I'm glad because you're starting to freak me out. I know you want to kill him."
"04","02","8","RYAN","Yeah, I do... but I'm not going to, all right? You either trust me on that or you don't."
"04","02","8","SETH","All right, I trust you."
"04","02","8","RYAN","All right, let's go to Ensenada and find him."
"04","02","8","SETH","But I can't keep watching you to make sure you're not calling your dad."
"04","02","8","SETH","It's going to be kind of hard now."
"04","02","9","KAITLIN","You guys are gayer than your dad."
"04","02","9","KAITLIN","That doesn't make it any less gay."
"04","02","9","KAITLIN","Yeah. Nice try. Big gay dad trumps slutty mom."
"04","02","9","KAITLIN","Yeah, ask anybody. Gay dad always trumps slutty mom."
"04","02","9","KAITLIN","No. He's at a conference in Seattle, and I'm sure totally alone."
"04","02","9","JULIE","Here you are. You are so... What are they doing?"
"04","02","9","KAITLIN","Their dad's gay."
"04","02","9","JULIE","I just thought you'd like to know that I just got called in to Dean Torres' office, and because of you, I have to work the clothing drive."
"04","02","9","KAITLIN","No way. That's too funny."
"04","02","9","KAITLIN","What?!"
"04","02","10","SANDY","You're giving awayRyan's leather jacket? He's not going to be happy."
"04","02","10","KIRSTEN","Well, he told me I could."
"04","02","10","SANDY","Wait a minute, this one's mine. I love wearing this jacket."
"04","02","10","KIRSTEN","That's the problem. They didn't call. I just... I feel so..."
"04","02","10","SANDY","Honey, Seth is going to call back, and then we'll get some real information, and then we can do something."
"04","02","10","KIRSTEN","I'm going to take this over to Harbor. Will you call me if anything..."
"04","02","10","SANDY","Of course."
"04","02","10","KIRSTEN","Do you want your jacket back?"
"04","02","10","SANDY","No... but thanks. Can I give you a hand?"
"04","02","10","KIRSTEN","No... but thanks."
"04","02","11","SETH","Oh. So this is what 15 bucks buys you in Ensenada."
"04","02","11","RYAN","Well, it's only for a couple hours."
"04","02","11","SETH","And we're here because?"
"04","02","11","RYAN","Well, I only know the bar he works at. But he only works nights, and, uh, I don't want him seeing us walking around during the day."
"04","02","11","SETH","Fair enough. I'm going to use the restroom. I did not want to go numero dos in the gas station."
"04","02","11","RYAN","It's all yours."
"04","02","11","SETH","Wow, the decorator clearly spent all her time in here. Whoa, man, you got to come see this spider. It's uh... Ryan, could you bring a magazine or a chair, Ryan? Ryan? Oh."
"04","02","12","RYAN","Does a guy named Volchok work here?"
"04","02","12","RYAN","Yeah? You know where I can find him?"
"04","02","12","RYAN","Hell, no. Anybody else know?"
"04","02","13","TAYLOR","Oh, hi. I'm Taylor. I'm one of Summer's friends from Newport."
"04","02","13","TAYLOR","Oh, we must have missed each other last night."
"04","02","13","TAYLOR","Got ya. College. Very cool. So, uh, Summer's really gotten into this whole green planet thing, huh? Still, you'd think she would have at least one picture of her friends, right? I mean, look at your nice collage. Who are all those guys?"
"04","02","13","TAYLOR","Guys like...? Oh."
"04","02","13","TAYLOR","No. No, of course not."
"04","02","13","TAYLOR","There's three guys in that picture."
"04","02","13","TAYLOR","Well, that's a very nice collage And it only highlights how impersonal Summer's side of the room is. She doesn't even have a single picture of her boyfriend."
"04","02","13","TAYLOR","Who's Che?"
"04","02","14","SETH","Well, excuse me. I-I was... I was, um... Excuse me, I don't want to... I don't want to bother you. I was just wondering..."
"04","02","14","SETH","Okay, uh, a friend of mine's in trouble, and I can't leave without him, so I..."
"04","02","14","SETH","Uh, you know what? You guys are busy, so..."
"04","02","14","SETH","Time! I got to find my buddy, so why don't you guys do shots?"
"04","02","14","SETH","Oh, well, that's a little fast, but..."
"04","02","14","SETH","Great. This is great. This is... Aah!"
"04","02","15","KAITLIN","Mom, I mean it. I really have to go study."
"04","02","15","JULIE","Please, honey. At least come up with an excuse I believe. This is nice."
"04","02","15","KAITLIN","So why don't you try it on?"
"04","02","15","JULIE","Because it's not a sample sale, Kaitlin, it's for the refugees."
"04","02","15","KAITLIN","The very lucky refugees."
"04","02","15","JULIE","Tell me about it."
"04","02","15","KIRSTEN","Oh, hi, Julie. I didn't know youwere doing this."
"04","02","15","JULIE","Hey, Kirsten. Well, you know, got to stay involved. But look at you. I mean, your kids don't even go here anymore."
"04","02","15","KIRSTEN","Right."
"04","02","15","JULIE","Something wrong?"
"04","02","15","KIRSTEN","The boys went to Mexico without asking us. I'm sure they're fine, but..."
"04","02","15","JULIE","Wait. Seth went, too? Why...? I mean, he just doesn't seem like Mr. Donkey show."
"04","02","15","KIRSTEN","Not that they're at a donkey show, or-or even know what-what a donkey show..."
"04","02","15","JULIE","Have you seen how great some of these clothes are? Excuse me."
"04","02","15","KAITLIN","What's a donkey show?"
"04","02","15","KIRSTEN","That's a question for your mother."
"04","02","16","JULIE","Hello?"
"04","02","16","RYAN","He wasn't there."
"04","02","16","JULIE","What?"
"04","02","16","RYAN","He got fired. Nobody knows where he is."
"04","02","16","JULIE","But he was supposed to be there. He has to be there."
"04","02","16","RYAN","Uh, I'll keep looking. I'll call you if I find anything."
"04","02","17","KIRSTEN","I hope everything's okay."
"04","02","17","KAITLIN","Maybe it was just Dr. Roberts. He could have some bad news or something."
"04","02","18","TAYLOR","Move it, hippies."
"04","02","18","SUMMER","Taylor, hey. Uh, you can have my bed tonight, 'cause I'm going to spend the night out here."
"04","02","18","TAYLOR","Uh-huh. I need to talk to you."
"04","02","18","SUMMER","Wait. Taylor, hold. Can't your secret wait?"
"04","02","18","TAYLOR","This isn't about that, Summer. What is going on with you and that Che character?"
"04","02","18","SUMMER","That Che character? What are you talking about?"
"04","02","18","TAYLOR","I have eyes, Summer, and ears, and I don't like what I' hearing, or what I'm seeing."
"04","02","18","SUMMER","Okay, maybe that makes sense in French, but not so much in English."
"04","02","18","TAYLOR","Have you called Seth back? You haven't, have you?"
"04","02","18","SUMMER","I'll call him later, okay? I'm busy."
"04","02","18","TAYLOR","You need to talk to him now."
"04","02","18","SUMMER","Look, they're going to cut down this tree, Taylor!"
"04","02","18","TAYLOR","Well, then we'll have a fire. Talk to him. Unless you're afraid that Johnny Appleseed might overhear."
"04","02","18","SUMMER","Hello? Seth? It's some Mexican guy. Happy?"
"04","02","18","TAYLOR","What? Seth?"
"04","02","19","SETH","Oh, this is good. Double Bob."
"04","02","19","SETH","Mmm."
"04","02","20","SANDY","We're doing the right thing in trusting them."
"04","02","20","KIRSTEN","I know."
"04","02","20","SANDY","They're adults. We couldn't have stopped them if we tried."
"04","02","20","KIRSTEN","I know."
"04","02","20","SANDY","I'm going to Mexico."
"04","02","20","KIRSTEN","I'm going with you."
"04","02","21","SETH","Uh, excuse me."
"04","02","21","SETH","Nothing, actually. 18 tequilas is my limit. I'm looking for my friend Ryan. Uh, he's-he's about... He's about... He's in there somewhere, and he's... and he's looking for a guy named Volchok. He kind of killed his girlfriend."
"04","02","21","SETH","I've got a tattoo, pal. A tattoo!"
"04","02","21","SETH","Okay."
"04","02","21","SETH","You know where he went? Because that guy in there was, like, very unhelpful."
"04","02","21","SETH","Yes."
"04","02","22","KIRSTEN","So now what? Ryan's not answeringhis phone and we keep getting that Mexican guy every time you call Seth."
"04","02","22","SANDY","Well, at least we know our phones work here. So they can reach us. I say we just start pounding the pavement, or the-the dirt, as the case may be."
"04","02","22","KIRSTEN","Were we crazy coming here?"
"04","02","22","SANDY","Driving all night into a foreign country where neither of usspeak the language and where we only have a vague notion of-of where they are? Yeah, that's a little crazy."
"04","02","22","KIRSTEN","How much longer do we keep doing this? Rescuing them every time they're in trouble."
"04","02","22","SANDY","Oh, I don't know. But for now, I think that's our job."
"04","02","22","KIRSTEN","I want you to know that I took two semesters of Spanish."
"04","02","22","SANDY","Well, then you can be our tour guide."
"04","02","23","SETH","Hi. Hi. Um, do you, uh... I'm so thirsty. Did you see my friend come in last night by any chance? I'm in the room without windows. Well, how many rooms do you have without windows? I see. Um, could I place a call to America, please?"
"04","02","24","TAYLOR","Lo se, Miguel, pero alomejor Maria solo esta pasando por una etapa. Si. Uh, <i>me-me tengo que ir."
"04","02","24","SUMMER","Who are you talking to?"
"04","02","24","TAYLOR","Oh, Miguel. The guy with Seth's phone. He is having problems with his girlfriend."
"04","02","24","SUMMER","Taylor... Where you going?"
"04","02","24","TAYLOR","Back to Newport. I realized that my problems are not going to be solved here. Because the truth is, you need help far more than I do."
"04","02","24","SUMMER","Hmm. God, have you ever tried sleeping outside? There is so much grass and you can't turn off the stars."
"04","02","24","TAYLOR","Look, you want to be the next Julia Butterfly Hill, I support that. But to push away Seth for some guy who read Siddhartha and did a couple of outward bound courses."
"04","02","24","SUMMER","Are you talking about Che? Che is just my friend and that is all. This is not a love triangle. I don't do love triangles anymore."
"04","02","24","TAYLOR","Fine, but you're using him and all of this save the Earth stuff to hide from Seth."
"04","02","24","SUMMER","I'm not hiding from Seth."
"04","02","24","TAYLOR","Really? Well, how often do you call him? Once a week? Once a month? Summer, just talk to me. Or better yet, talk to Seth. Write him a letter. But you have to tell him what you're going through. He'll understand."
"04","02","24","SUMMER","I think you spent too much time in France, because here in America, we hide our feelings. And since when did saving the Earth become such a bad thing?"
"04","02","24","TAYLOR","I never said that."
"04","02","24","SUMMER","No, but you came here with this big secret, but you've spent the whole time telling me what's wrong with my life! And you're the one that's avoiding, avoider!"
"04","02","24","TAYLOR","Be that way. But you're going to lose Seth. And then you'll wish you listened to me. And I was going to tell you how I went to France, got married, and now I have to get a divorce from my French husband, and you would have found the story très intéressant. Au revoir, Summer."
"04","02","24","SUMMER","Hey, where did this stupid espresso machine come from anyway?"
"04","02","24","TAYLOR","It's a gift!"
"04","02","25","SETH","Hey. I couldn't find your toothbrush. Uh, just don't leave. So did you kill him? I mean, that was the plan, right? The real plan. Not the lie you told me when you said trust me, man?"
"04","02","25","RYAN","You-you don't understand."
"04","02","25","SETH","The guy killed Marissa, you loved her. What don't I understand?"
"04","02","25","RYAN","No one made you come."
"04","02","25","SETH","You think I want to be here? Summer came back for the first time in months, left without saying good-bye. I could be losing her right now."
"04","02","25","RYAN","All right, go home."
"04","02","25","SETH","That is not the point."
"04","02","25","RYAN","I didn't find him."
"04","02","25","SETH","Good, great, then let's both go home together."
"04","02","25","RYAN","And I'm not leaving until I find him."
"04","02","25","SETH","So then, what are you going to do, you going to stay here forever? You going to live in Ensenada? You going to open a piñataria? Huh? You going to open a burrito stand? You know what, fine, if I tell you where he is, you promise not to kill him?"
"04","02","25","RYAN","What?"
"04","02","25","SETH","I went to the bar last night-- I guess one you'd already been to-- and apparently the waitress and Volchok had had a thing..."
"04","02","25","RYAN","Where is he?"
"04","02","25","SETH","Do you promise not to do anything?"
"04","02","25","RYAN","I'm gonna ask you one more time-- where is he?"
"04","02","26","KAITLIN","What are you watching?"
"04","02","26","JULIE","TV's Dumbest Cops. Are people in America really this fat?"
"04","02","26","KAITLIN","You haven't moved in 18 hours. Is everything okay?"
"04","02","26","JULIE","Fine. The world is an amoral toilet bowl, and one day we'll all be flushed."
"04","02","26","KAITLIN","Okay, wow. That was a really uplifting message for your daughter."
"04","02","26","JULIE","It's better you know now."
"04","02","26","KAITLIN","Okay. I'm just gonna go to the clothing drive."
"04","02","26","JULIE","Why?"
"04","02","26","KAITLIN","Because, believe it or not, I actually want a life. Right now that means school and a stupid clothing drive. So I suck it up. You know, some of us are still alive."
"04","02","27","SETH","You alone?"
"04","02","27","SETH","The girl you... worked with, the waitress at the bar."
"04","02","27","SETH","Well, he's gonna have to get in line-- Ryan's in Ensenada."
"04","02","27","SETH","I thought about it, but in the end I gave him the wrong address."
"04","02","27","SETH","I'm not. I just don't want Ryan to ruin his life by murdering you."
"04","02","27","SETH","So, you just taking off?"
"04","02","27","SETH","He's gonna find you again."
"04","02","27","SETH","So, what, then... you keep running, he keeps chasing you, best-case scenario, you do that for the rest of your lives?"
"04","02","27","SETH","You should turn yourself in."
"04","02","27","SETH","My dad's a lawyer-- he could help you get a good deal."
"04","02","27","SETH","He could make sure you're in a safe place."
"04","02","27","SETH","You can't keep running from this."
"04","02","27","SETH","I'm not talking about Ryan. You should let my dad help you. You didn't mean to kill her."
"04","02","28","RYAN","Seth set me up, didn't he?"
"04","02","28","KIRSTEN","He called; he was worried."
"04","02","28","SANDY","Come on, let's go home."
"04","02","28","RYAN","Why? So we can pretend like everything's the way it used to be?"
"04","02","28","SANDY","We all miss her. It's never gonna be the way that it used to be. But we are still a family."
"04","02","28","RYAN","You don't understand. He's here."
"04","02","28","SETH","No. He's gone."
"04","02","29","SUMMER","Taylor?"
"04","02","29","TAYLOR","Don't worry, Summer, I'm leaving. I was just postponing the trauma of going though security."
"04","02","29","SUMMER","Look, I'm... I'm so sorry."
"04","02","29","TAYLOR","Oh, my God, I am, too. Oh, I don't want to fight with you. Even if you are all gross and smelly."
"04","02","29","SUMMER","And you can show up on my doorstep anytime."
"04","02","29","TAYLOR","And how you live your life is your business."
"04","02","29","SUMMER","No, you were right."
"04","02","29","TAYLOR","You are in love with Che?"
"04","02","29","SUMMER","No. No, about the Seth thing. I have been pulling away. It's just..."
"04","02","29","TAYLOR","Summer, I understand. But Seth will, too. Just try."
"04","02","29","SUMMER","So when you said that, uh, you got married, did that mean that, um..."
"04","02","30","SUMMER","Oh, my God. But how?"
"04","02","30","TAYLOR","I keep asking myself the same question. I-I met him, and the next thing I knew, we were in his family's chapel in Burgundy saying... I remember telling Ethan Hawke at the rehearsal dinner..."
"04","02","30","SUMMER","Ethan Hawke was at your rehearsal dinner?"
"04","02","30","TAYLOR","Oh, yes. Henri Michel translated one of his novels into French as a joke, of course, but don't tell Ethan that. Um, I got to go."
"04","02","30","SUMMER","But Taylor, you got married."
"04","02","30","TAYLOR","It was Paris. It seemed like the thing to do. Okay, promise me you'll write to Seth? Okay, see you at Thanksgiving. Bye. Oh, by the way, your roommate is a big slut."
"04","02","30","SUMMER","Yeah, I know."
"04","02","30","TAYLOR","Okay."
"04","02","31","KAITLIN","Will you guys hurry up?"
"04","02","31","KAITLIN","Your dad would be extremely proud."
"04","02","31","JULIE","Kaitlin?"
"04","02","31","KAITLIN","Mom. What are you doing here?"
"04","02","31","JULIE","Well, uh, what you said earlier struck a nerve. Life might be difficult, but it's our job to make the best of it. You inspired me. So, what are you doing? How can I help?"
"04","02","31","KAITLIN","Um, well, the school promised a local shelter some clothes, so we're just bringing them over. But I think we have it handled."
"04","02","31","JULIE","Oh, okay."
"04","02","31","JULIE","Mm-hmm. Okay."
"04","02","31","JULIE","Amy Bennett buys used clothing?"
"04","02","31","JULIE","But who would do...? Oh, no."
"04","02","31","KAITLIN","Oh, crap."
"04","02","32","SUMMER","Dear, Seth, I know you think I've changed, and I'm avoiding you.. Dear, Seth... Dear, Seth, the reason I've been so distant is that... The truth is... The truth is... Seth, I still love you. I really, really still love you. I just can't... Oh, I just can't."
"04","02","33","SANDY","Thanks for driving. I didn't get much sleep last night."
"04","02","33","SETH","Yeah, no problem."
"04","02","33","SANDY","You did the right thing, Seth."
"04","02","33","SETH","You mean, betraying my best friend by ratting him out to my parents?"
"04","02","33","SANDY","You might have saved his life today. And sooner or later, he's going to realize that."
"04","02","34","KIRSTEN","You okay? You hungry? This was my worst nightmare, when you first came to live with us, that Seth would follow you somewhere and get hurt."
"04","02","34","RYAN","I know, I shouldn't have taken him, I'm sorry."
"04","02","34","KIRSTEN","What I was going to say, all that's changed is now I have two children to worry about."
"04","02","35","SUMMER","Glad to see me? I know. Um, I made wheat grass soup so we can stay out there all night if have to."
"04","02","35","SUMMER","We have a tree to save."
"04","02","35","SUMMER","But there's no time. There's no time for anything. We have to save this tree."
"04","02","35","SUMMER","I can't believe this."
"04","02","35","SUMMER","So, that's it? Well, I mean, can't we just go out there anyway?"
"04","02","35","SUMMER","Exactly. That's exactly what I mean."
"04","02","35","SUMMER","Yeah."
"04","02","36","SANDY","Oh, my gosh."
"04","02","36","SETH","Yeah, I know. It... Some marines were helping me look for Ryan. It was a bonding thing."
"04","02","36","SANDY","Wow. It's-It's-It's... You know, the artwork is really good. What's this... What's this say beneath?"
"04","02","36","SETH","Uh, Senorita Vixen. One of the marines got one, too. He thought it was pretty cool. He may have been ... though."
"04","02","36","SANDY","You know, it does have a certain..."
"04","02","36","SETH","Gay vibe. Were you going to say gay vibe?"
"04","02","36","SANDY","Exactly. Let's see what Summer has to say. You know, the one thing I keep thinking about... ...is how Ryan could have found Volchok in the first place."
"04","02","36","SETH","Oh, please, just leave me out of it."
"04","02","36","SANDY","It would have taken a private investigator, which means money. And any way I cut it, it leads back to just one person."
"04","02","37","JULIE","There'll be no more hanging out with Brad and Eric. You're to come straight home after school. Do you have any idea how lucky you are that Dean Torres didn't expel you?"
"04","02","37","KAITLIN","Mom, this whole thing is just a crock anyway."
"04","02","37","JULIE","And how is that?"
"04","02","37","KAITLIN","Do you really think that Sudanese refugees have an overwhelming need for Paul Frank tops and last season Manolo Blahniks?"
"04","02","37","JULIE","So, what, you think you can steal them?"
"04","02","37","KAITLIN","Look, I did research on the Web. They have mountains of donated clothing in warehouses in New Jersey. They have all they've ever needed."
"04","02","37","JULIE","You just made that up."
"04","02","37","KAITLIN","Maybe. But it sounded true, didn't it?"
"04","02","37","JULIE","Kaitlin...I can't do this. I can't... I can't keep this family together and have you running around like Miss Clockwork Orange. I... I can't. Honey, please. I need your help."
"04","02","37","KAITLIN","Mom, do you really think that Dr. Roberts is at that conference by himself?"
"04","02","37","JULIE","No, of course not. Look, maybe I can make you some ice cream... if you want."
"04","02","37","JULIE","That would be nice. Just hold on. Hello? Yes, of course. I'll be right there. Honey, I have to step out for a minute. Take a rain check, okay?"
"04","02","37","KAITLIN","Okay."
"04","02","38","JULIE","Sandy, what is it? You said it was important."
"04","02","38","SANDY","I thought you might want to know that Ryan and Seth are back home, that Volchok's disappeared."
"04","02","38","JULIE","What are you talking about?"
"04","02","38","SANDY","Stop it. You told Ryan where to find Volchok. Even for you, this is a new low."
"04","02","38","JULIE","Okay, you know what? You're crazy. I'm just going to say good night."
"04","02","38","SANDY","You sent Ryan down there to commit a murder. I could have you arrested."
"04","02","38","JULIE","But then you'd get Ryan arrested, and you're not going to do that, are you?"
"04","02","38","SANDY","If anything had happened to him or to Seth..."
"04","02","38","JULIE","Okay, it's late, and I'm not in the mood for threats."
"04","02","38","SANDY","Sit down. After everything our families have been through, you would put our kids in danger?"
"04","02","38","JULIE","At least you still have all your kids."
"04","02","39","SETH","Hey. How was your drive?"
"04","02","39","KIRSTEN","Quiet. Yours?"
"04","02","39","SETH","We got stopped at the border.I think they had a picture of dad from his long-hair days. Did he say anything about me? Maybe a rant about Judas?"
"04","02","39","KIRSTEN","Of course not."
"04","02","39","SETH","You okay?"
"04","02","39","KIRSTEN","Yeah. It's just been a long couple of days. But I'm really glad you're home."
"04","03","1","SANDY","Well us he can ignore. When Ryan doesn't speak to Seth, that's when I start to worry."
"04","03","1","SANDY","Yeah. Right in the path of Hurricane Julie."
"04","03","2","RYAN","Ever since we got back from Mexico, things haven't been the same."
"04","03","2","JULIE","Tell me about it. I've been banned from your house. Your parents have been mad at me before..."
"04","03","2","KIRSTEN","It's never been this bad. We're excluding her from Thanksgiving."
"04","03","2","SANDY","Well, when you send our kids on a murder mission, you get knocked off the guest list. House rules."
"04","03","3","SETH","Hey Summer, just calling to say happy Thanksgiving. Well, I use the term happy loosely. It's actually shaping out to be kind of an awkward Thanksgiving."
"04","03","4","SETH","Thing is Ryan and I have never been in a fight before. But I've got a feeling things'll blow over today, 'cause they have to. It's Thanksgiving."
"04","03","5","SANDY","It's Thanksgiving. Now you just watch, this family's gonna come together for the holidays. That's what we Coens do. (Ryan and Seth walk into the kitchen.) Hey."
"04","03","5","SETH","Hey."
"04","03","5","RYAN","Hey."
"04","03","6","RYAN","Sure."
"04","03","7","SANDY","Should be ready any second. (Sandy's cellphone rings.) Oh, I hate to miss this spirit of discussion, but I gotta take this. Hello? (Sandy walks into an adjacent room.) Uh huh. Where are you?"
"04","03","8","KIRSTEN","OK, enough of this! No more tip-toeing, no more silences, it is Thanksgiving and this family is gonna get over what happened and move on with their lives."
"04","03","8","SETH","I don't know if it's that easy."
"04","03","8","KIRSTEN","No one said it was gonna be easy, but this family is gonna work together and make Thanksgiving dinner. You two, grocery store, together."
"04","03","8","SETH","I've got to pick up Summer..."
"04","03","8","KIRSTEN","You can go before. List, here. (She hands Seth a shopping list.) And when you get back, we're gonna cook this bird together. (Sandy walks back into the kitchen.) Including you. No surfing, no golf."
"04","03","8","SANDY","You got it. I do have to go to the office..."
"04","03","8","KIRSTEN","Sandy..."
"04","03","8","SANDY","But I'll only be gone a few hours, and when I'm back I'm all yours."
"04","03","8","KIRSTEN","Great. Now you can all change and wash up. But you report for duty in one hour."
"04","03","9","SANDY","Ryan, are you gonna be OK? 'Cause if you can't put your anger about Volchok aside, even for today, then there's no point to any of this."
"04","03","9","RYAN","No I'm not angry. I... I just wish he was dead, that's all."
"04","03","10","SANDY","It's me. Are you still there?"
"04","03","12","SANDY","I'm not your friend, I'm your lawyer, and I'll help you get through this. But the less you talk, the better. Alright?"
"04","03","13","SETH","I brought you a bagel."
"04","03","14","TAYLOR","A bagel? I asked for an egg-white omelette and some cantaloupe."
"04","03","14","SETH","Taylor, I said you could hide out in my room for a couple of days, I did not say there would be room service."
"04","03","15","TAYLOR","Seth, one day when I'm no longer sleeping under your bed you're gonna miss me."
"04","03","15","SETH","And when will that be, 'cause you kinda made it sound like this was a temporary thing."
"04","03","15","TAYLOR","I know. I know, you think it would be healthier for me to confront my fear and face my mom."
"04","03","15","SETH","More like Summer's coming home and I was hoping we could get it on up here. You understand."
"04","03","15","TAYLOR","Right, of course. You guys need alone time together. I mean like you said your relationship is just hanging by a thread."
"04","03","15","SETH","I didn't say that."
"04","03","15","TAYLOR","Really? You didn't? Oh... I must have dreamt it. You know since I've been on the run my dreams have been so vivid. Like last night I dream that G�rard D�pardieu and I were team mates on the Amazing Race."
"04","03","15","SETH","Wait, back up. Is this about your trip to Brown last week? Did something happen with Summer?"
"04","03","15","TAYLOR","No, of course not. No she's still the same old Summer... She might not smell like the same old Summer, but inside she's... she's still the same girl."
"04","03","15","SETH","I wouldn't know. I feel like we've barely spoken in weeks."
"04","03","15","TAYLOR","Seth, you guys are gonna be fine. Just think, she's on her way here right now."
"04","03","16","SUMMER","I don't think I'm coming."
"04","03","16","SUMMER","Tell me now."
"04","03","16","SUMMER","Exactly. Millions of turkeys being senselessly slaughtered so us Americans can get even fatter?"
"04","03","16","SUMMER","I know you do. I just... I don't think I can support this holiday, you know? I think I'm just gonna sit this one out."
"04","03","16","SUMMER","Uh, I don't know... I'm just not up for it. (A dog starts barking from inside of Mr Roberts' house.) Is that a dog?"
"04","03","17","KAITLIN","Well nothing now. Although a few minutes ago she kinda took a tinkle in your den."
"04","03","17","KAITLIN","Dude, I found her at the pier. And I'm not taking her back. She totally fits in my purse."
"04","03","17","KAITLIN","Well, yesterday she almost sucked her up in a vaccum. I guess to her the dog is invisible. Like me. Oh, by the way, I think your shoes are cashed."
"04","03","18","KAITLIN","Oh I forgot to ask you, how'd your conference go? (Pause.) Thought so."
"04","03","19","SUMMER","Oh, it's alright. Dad, it sounds like you're in the loony bin."
"04","03","19","SUMMER","Alright, see you in six hours."
"04","03","19","SUMMER","You too. Bye. (She hangs up.) Crap!"
"04","03","20","JULIE","I know it's Thanksgiving, but you're a private investigator. Can't you find a guy and eat turkey at the same time?"
"04","03","21","JULIE","Call me back in five will you? (She hangs up. To Mr Roberts) Hi, sorry. Do you want a waffle?"
"04","03","21","JULIE","No, Neal, I'm sorry. I have to cook."
"04","03","21","JULIE","Well we're not. Kirsten's turkey is always dry, and Sandy with his long boring speeches about the importance of family. I'd just as soon eat in."
"04","03","22","JULIE","Then I should go to the market. Can I have my cellphone please? (Pause. Mr Roberts hands Julie her cellphone.) Thank you."
"04","03","22","JULIE","Yeah, yeah. After the holidays. Of course."
"04","03","23","SETH","So, what's next?"
"04","03","23","RYAN","Parsley."
"04","03","23","SETH","Wow, this trip to the grocery store has been a real success. I'm sure silent cart pushing is exactly what my mom envisioned when she sent us here."
"04","03","23","RYAN","Well what do you expect? You think we can get over everything just because we're buying parsley?"
"04","03","23","SETH","It's more than a garnish Ryan. It's a good omen."
"04","03","23","RYAN","Yeah..."
"04","03","24","SETH","Speaking of omens..."
"04","03","24","RYAN","Julie."
"04","03","24","JULIE","Ryan."
"04","03","24","SETH","Hello Julie. I wanted to thank you for that travel tip. Ensenada turned out to be the perfect vacation spot for the Coens. We may get a timeshare."
"04","03","24","JULIE","Save it Seth. I already got the lecture from your dad. Ryan, would you care to join me in the samples?"
"04","03","24","SETH","I'll get the sweet potatoes."
"04","03","26","JULIE","It's delicious. (She and Ryan turn their backs to the saleswoman.) So the PI swears he'll have a location for Volchok by Monday."
"04","03","26","RYAN","What do we do until then?"
"04","03","26","JULIE","Just, uh, wait. I guess I'll call you in the morning, we'll make a plan. Until then act normal. (They turn and face the saleswoman.) Thank you."
"04","03","27","KIRSTEN","Hey Sandy, I was just wondering when you were going to be home to help me with... (She walks into the kitchen and sees Taylor eating food.) Oh my God. Taylor, I thought you were in France."
"04","03","27","TAYLOR","I am... uh, I was. In fact what am I doing here where gay Paris beckons. Au revoir."
"04","03","28","KIRSTEN","Hold on! (Taylor turns around and walks back towards Kirsten.) When a kid is stealing stuffing in my kitchen, that's usually a sign that something's wrong."
"04","03","28","TAYLOR","I would talk to you Mrs Coen, but this is simply too private."
"04","03","28","KIRSTEN","I'll make you a plate of food."
"04","03","29","JULIE","Ryan, listen. The important thing is Sandy can't suspect us. He needs to feel like we've moved on, that we've let go."
"04","03","29","RYAN","Yeah well that's gonna be kinda hard. He knows I haven't given upon Volchok. Kinda got into it this morning."
"04","03","29","JULIE","Then you need to go smooth things over. Smile, apologize, lie, whatever it takes. Ryan, you wanna get this son of a bitch just as badly as I do. That's a really hard thing to do with Sandy Coen watching your every move."
"04","03","29","RYAN","Alright. I'll stop by his office on the way back."
"04","03","29","JULIE","Oh Ryan, one more thing. Do you happen to know how to cook a turkey? (Ryan stares at her blankly.) Never mind."
"04","03","30","KIRSTEN","You got married?!"
"04","03","30","TAYLOR","His name was Henri-Michel, and I met him outside the Place des Vosges. He wooed me for a few whirlwind weeks, and the next thing I knew I was in his family's chapel in Burgundy, tipsy of a 1953 Ch�teau Margot, and vowing to love until death do us part."
"04","03","30","KIRSTEN","I can't believe this is happening. Taylor, you're usually so responsible."
"04","03","30","TAYLOR","Well needless to say it was une erreur. Now he won't agree to an annulment. He is a stubborn man. Sexy and well endowed, but stubborn. So I came home and... I'm just too afraid to tell my mom now."
"04","03","30","KIRSTEN","I've known your mom for a long time. She might be tough, but she's your mom, which means that she loves you no matter what."
"04","03","30","TAYLOR","That's so sweet and... totally wrong."
"04","03","30","KIRSTEN","Don't you think you're underestimating her?"
"04","03","30","TAYLOR","No. Oh my God! Oh my God, I just had the best idea. You could tell her. Now that we're like sisters I'm sure you'd be happy to."
"04","03","30","KIRSTEN","No, that's your job."
"04","03","30","TAYLOR","Bon Dieu, je suis tr�s d�sol�, mais j'ai peur... (Taylor starts crying.)"
"04","03","30","KIRSTEN","OK. I will talk to her, but I'm not doing your dirty work. I am just gonna put her in the right frame of mind."
"04","03","30","TAYLOR","Great! That's great! Uh, she's in charge of the Turkey Trot, that prefixed meal over at the yacht club. She'll be there all afternoon."
"04","03","30","KIRSTEN","No, no, I can't do it today. I have a thousand things to do Taylor."
"04","03","30","TAYLOR","Mon Dieu, mon coeur est cass�..."
"04","03","30","KIRSTEN","OK fine! I will talk to her today but you're gonna have to help me cook."
"04","03","30","TAYLOR","Oh Kirsten, I will be the best sous-chef ever. You just watch."
"04","03","31","SETH","Hey!"
"04","03","31","SUMMER","Hi."
"04","03","31","SETH","Hey. (They kiss awkwardly. Seth hands Summer a bouquet of roses.) Here, I sprung for roses. The cheapskate in me wanted to get you carnations, but it's a special occasion."
"04","03","31","SUMMER","It is?"
"04","03","31","SETH","Yeah, you're here. And not just for a whirlwind comic book intervention but for an actual visit."
"04","03","31","SUMMER","Well it's only for three nights."
"04","03","31","SETH","It's longer than you think."
"04","03","32","SANDY","Uh huh. Thanks Greg. (He hangs up and sits down. To Volchok) So, I'm gonna go see the DA, enter your guilty plea, and hopefully we can settle on a charge and a sentence by tonight."
"04","03","32","SANDY","For what you did, yeah, I'd say so."
"04","03","32","SANDY","I am helping you. Helping turn you over to the authorities so you can get the punishment you deserve. You made a lot of mistakes. But you turned yourself in, and that was the right thing to do."
"04","03","32","SANDY","That's guilt for you. Follow you around. But you're here now, so we'll find a hotel room for you while I work things out with Otis."
"04","03","34","SANDY","Well listen, the sooner you're off the street, the sooner Ryan can start his life again."
"04","03","34","SANDY","Oh me too, you have no idea."
"04","03","35","RYAN","Excuse me, you know where Sandy Coen's office is?"
"04","03","35","RYAN","Oh, I did?"
"04","03","36","TAYLOR","No. No, no, no Kirsten. Here, let me. (Taylor picks up a small brush and starts brushing the turkey.) You wanna just lightly kiss the bird. Like so."
"04","03","36","KIRSTEN","I see. (Ryan appears at the back of the kitchen.) Oh hey Ryan. Did you know Taylor was back in town?"
"04","03","36","TAYLOR","Hello Ryan! I know, you must be confused as to why I'm here, but in time..."
"04","03","36","RYAN","Do you know where Sandy is?"
"04","03","36","KIRSTEN","He called a while ago, he said he had some errands to run."
"04","03","36","RYAN","Did he say where he was going?"
"04","03","36","KIRSTEN","No. Is everything OK?"
"04","03","36","RYAN","Yeah it's fine. I'll be back later."
"04","03","37","KIRSTEN","I was hoping that you'd help with dinner..."
"04","03","38","SUMMER","Ok, but only for a little while. My dad needs me back in crazy just."
"04","03","38","SETH","Just want you to witness the magic of a Coen family Thanksgiving, even if only for a few moments."
"04","03","38","SUMMER","Alright."
"04","03","38","SETH","Hey Ryan, look who showed up."
"04","03","39","RYAN","Hey."
"04","03","39","SUMMER","Hey Atwood..."
"04","03","39","SETH","See there's magic everywhere."
"04","03","40","TAYLOR","Goards. It nees goards."
"04","03","40","SUMMER","Hi guys."
"04","03","40","KIRSTEN","Hi Summer! Oh it's good to see you!"
"04","03","40","SUMMER","You too."
"04","03","41","TAYLOR","Welcome home! (They hug.) Oh, did you bathe in a creek."
"04","03","41","SETH","Taylor, what are you doing out?"
"04","03","41","TAYLOR","Oh, um, I came clean to your mom. And now I'm helping her through Thanksgiving."
"04","03","41","KIRSTEN","Taylor, now that Seth and Summer are here, why don't they take over and we'll go talk to your mother."
"04","03","41","SETH","You're taking on Veronica Townsend? It's a death wish."
"04","03","41","KIRSTEN","Why don't you just paste the turkey."
"04","03","41","TAYLOR","But just very lightly, with the little brush thing, and not..."
"04","03","41","SETH","Ok, alright."
"04","03","42","SUMMER","Gosh I haven't been in this house in so long."
"04","03","42","SETH","Well the house misses you, so do I. In fact, upstairs has been asking for you."
"04","03","43","SUMMER","Oh really?"
"04","03","43","SETH","Mhmm."
"04","03","43","SUMMER","Well I've gotta get back to my dad's house."
"04","03","43","SETH","Give me five minutes."
"04","03","43","SUMMER","Promise?"
"04","03","44","SETH","Keep me honest. Ten."
"04","03","45","JULIE","Fantastic. You wouldn't happen to know how to cook a turkey would you?"
"04","03","45","JULIE","Well Jimmy always did it, and after we broke up, then we ended up at the Coens."
"04","03","46","JULIE","Oh, get that will you?"
"04","03","47","RYAN","Hey, is Julie home?"
"04","03","47","RYAN","I just need a minute of her time."
"04","03","47","RYAN","I don't think you really understand what's going on here."
"04","03","47","RYAN","I get it, I'm sorry."
"04","03","49","TAYLOR","OK, off you go."
"04","03","49","KIRSTEN","Are you sure you don't wanna come with me?"
"04","03","49","TAYLOR","No. No, no, no. My stomach's kinda doing that flip-floppy thing it does every time I see her."
"04","03","50","KIRSTEN","Thanks Veronica. Actually I just came by to help."
"04","03","51","KIRSTEN","So, this is your first holiday without Taylor. That must be hard for you."
"04","03","53","KIRSTEN","Actually I was talking about you and Taylor."
"04","03","53","TAYLOR","Mom, I need to talk to you."
"04","03","53","KIRSTEN","I'm gonna leave you two alone. (Whispering to Taylor)You'll be fine."
"04","03","54","SETH","We only have a few minutes together. You sure you have to do yoga?"
"04","03","54","SUMMER","I've been on a plane all day. I'm trying to reverse the bloodflow. Fresh oxygen to the brain gives you clarity and peace of mind."
"04","03","54","SETH","I still can't believe you had no reaction to my tattoo."
"04","03","54","SUMMER","I had a reaction. I told you to get that thing removed!"
"04","03","54","SETH","Yeah I'll get it removed."
"04","03","55","SUMMER","Did it hurt?"
"04","03","55","SETH","Whatever. I was with my marine buds. I barely felt a thing."
"04","03","55","SUMMER","I bet you cried."
"04","03","55","SETH","Like a baby. I'm glad you're home."
"04","03","55","SUMMER","Me too."
"04","03","56","SETH","What's wrong?"
"04","03","56","SUMMER","I just... I get upset when I think about... all of the food that the average American consumes during Thanksgiving when so many people go without!"
"04","03","56","SETH","Huh?"
"04","03","56","SUMMER","We need to do something. We gotta go. Gotta go somewhere!"
"04","03","56","SETH","Go? Go where?"
"04","03","56","SUMMER","The soup kitchen. We're gonna feed the homeless."
"04","03","56","SETH","Do we have to? We're already feeding Ryan and he was homeless once."
"04","03","57","SUMMER","Hey you can go or you can stay."
"04","03","58","SANDY","Summer! How are you doing?"
"04","03","58","SUMMER","Better than the 2.8 billion people living below the poverty level. Are you OK with that statistic Mr Coen? I don't think so. That's why I have to go."
"04","03","59","SANDY","Who knew, out of all you kids, she'd turn out to be the young Sandy Coen!"
"04","03","59","SETH","Had to rub off on someone. We'll be back soon."
"04","03","60","SANDY","Hey, honey."
"04","03","60","KIRSTEN","You know I thought we were going to be having dinner as a family and here I am being driven crazy by Taylor Townsend."
"04","03","60","SANDY","I got news. Volchok came to see me today."
"04","03","60","KIRSTEN","Volchok, Volchok?"
"04","03","60","SANDY","He turned himself in. I've put him in a hotel while Otis finishes his paperwork. I figure we'll tell Ryan after the holiday."
"04","03","61","RYAN","After he's already in jail. So we can't get at him."
"04","03","61","SANDY","Well yeah the thought did cross my mind so don't bother asking me where he is 'cause I'm not gonna tell you."
"04","03","61","RYAN","Alright look you stopped me from going after him, that I get. But to defend him..."
"04","03","61","SANDY","I'm not defending him Ryan. I'm negotiating the terms of his surrender. And he's gonna get every bit of what he deserves."
"04","03","61","KIRSTEN","Ryan, Sandy and I would only do what's best for you."
"04","03","61","RYAN","You wanna do what's in my best interest?"
"04","03","61","SANDY","Always."
"04","03","61","RYAN","Leave me alone."
"04","03","62","SANDY","Ryan... (Sandy walks after him.) Come on, wait."
"04","03","63","RYAN","Hey. You're friends with Volchok, right?"
"04","03","63","RYAN","Yeah well he's back in town. I need to find out where he's staying."
"04","03","63","RYAN","You got her number."
"04","03","63","RYAN","I'm gonna need that number."
"04","03","64","RYAN","I don't wanna talk about it."
"04","03","64","RYAN","And I just need to find the guy."
"04","03","64","RYAN","He must have called you, told you he was coming back."
"04","03","64","RYAN","Good. Thanks for meeting me..."
"04","03","64","RYAN","Good advice..."
"04","03","65","SANDY","Hello?"
"04","03","65","KIRSTEN","Any luck?"
"04","03","65","SANDY","No. I've been to the Bait Shop, the diner. I can't find him anywhere."
"04","03","65","KIRSTEN","I just feel strange to be cooking with all this going on. Maybe we should call dinner off."
"04","03","65","SANDY","No, keep it going. I got another idea where he might be."
"04","03","65","KIRSTEN","Well call me as soon as you... (Taylor walks into the kitchen, visibly distraught.) Uh, I gotta go. What happened?"
"04","03","65","TAYLOR","She called me irresponsible, and stupid, and then she said that I would never be truly thin because I have a naturally large thorax."
"04","03","65","KIRSTEN","Oh Taylor, that's awful."
"04","03","65","TAYLOR","And the worst part is... (Taylor tastes some of Kirsten's cooking.) Oh my God, these are like cardboard. You're gonna want to add some cream. And the worst part is she said I'm no longer welcome in her house. I am le vagabond."
"04","03","65","KIRSTEN","You can stay here."
"04","03","65","TAYLOR","Forever?"
"04","03","65","KIRSTEN","Well... no. For one night. But we'll find somewhere for you to stay."
"04","03","65","TAYLOR","Thank you Kiki. And I am so sorry that after all you've done for me I abandoned ship during the crucial hour before Thanksgiving. Now let's see how you're doing with those pies. Did you smash the pecans finely like I told you to?"
"04","03","65","KIRSTEN","I skipped the pecan pie."
"04","03","65","TAYLOR","You skipped the pecan?"
"04","03","65","KIRSTEN","Well one pumpkin will be fine. There's only five of us."
"04","03","66","SETH","You may wanna rethink that. We invited over some friends. Love the Coen open door policy."
"04","03","66","KIRSTEN","There aren't your friends."
"04","03","66","SUMMER","Well we were trying to help out at the soup kitchen and apparently they said they had enough volunteers. Like such a thing exists! Uh, just follow me to the family room."
"04","03","66","SETH","Oh, it's the first one on the left. Take these matches."
"04","03","66","SETH","Alright, you're next. (The homeless men walk through to the living room. To Kirsten) Sorry."
"04","03","66","KIRSTEN","They can't stay."
"04","03","66","SETH","Well can't tell them to go. Summer'll have a nervous breakdown. She's hanging by a thread."
"04","03","66","TAYLOR","You know I used to volunteer at the Y, teaching personal hygiene. So I could just run through the basics with them. Unfortunately it means that I wouldn't be able to help you in here."
"04","03","66","KIRSTEN","Really? That sounds great. They stay, you keep them in one place, you keep them occupied."
"04","03","66","SETH","OK. (Seth walks into the living room.) Who here has not seen Battlestar Galactica season one?"
"04","03","66","SETH","Get ready to have your mind blown."
"04","03","67","TAYLOR","Don't worry Kiki, I've got your back."
"04","03","68","SANDY","Julie."
"04","03","68","JULIE","I thought you weren't speaking to me."
"04","03","68","SANDY","I'm not calling to make peace. I'm looking for Ryan."
"04","03","68","JULIE","Ryan? You told me to stay away from him, remember?"
"04","03","68","SANDY","Oh come on. He called you as soon as he found out I had Volchok in custody."
"04","03","69","JULIE","Volchok is in custody?"
"04","03","69","SANDY","So you really didn't know, huh?"
"04","03","69","JULIE","No. No I didn't."
"04","03","69","SANDY","He turned himself in this morning. I already spoke to the DA, it should be a done deal by tonight."
"04","03","69","JULIE","So it's really over..."
"04","03","69","SANDY","I sure as hell hope so. (Julie hangs up. She seems to be in shock.) Julie? Julie?"
"04","03","70","KAITLIN","Mom are you OK?"
"04","03","70","JULIE","Do I wanna lay in the dark with nothing but my thoughts to distract me? No, Kaitlin, that is not what I wanna do."
"04","03","70","KAITLIN","OK, never mind. I'll just go find my dog. (Kaitlin walks out of the kitchen. Mr Roberts is walking in to the kitchen.) She's having a meltdown. Good luck."
"04","03","70","JULIE","I'm fine. I... I have a turkey to cook, potatoes to mash and... and that's all I have to think about. Just... just think about the task at hand. Will you get out of here? You're in the way. I have to paste a turkey."
"04","03","72","SANDY","Close, but he's not here."
"04","03","72","RYAN","So I'll keep looking."
"04","03","72","SANDY","Why don't you come with me?"
"04","03","72","RYAN","Yeah? So you can take me home and give me one of your lectures."
"04","03","72","SANDY","Oh, we're beyond all that."
"04","03","72","RYAN","Alright. So what are you doing here?"
"04","03","72","SANDY","Why don't you find out? Come on."
"04","03","73","SUMMER","There aren't enough chairs. Darryl needs a chair!"
"04","03","73","SETH","Summer, can we talk..."
"04","03","73","SUMMER","I'm just gonna make a seating area out of cushions on the floor."
"04","03","73","SETH","Summer, we need to talk."
"04","03","74","JULIE","I can't talk, I have to mash these potatoes. Hand me the cream."
"04","03","75","JULIE","Now these are ruined. I'm going back to the store."
"04","03","76","KAITLIN","You wouldn't happen to have any baking soda would you?"
"04","03","76","JULIE","Kaitlin, get that dog out of my house right now or so help me God I will have it put to sleep."
"04","03","76","KAITLIN","God, you would wouldn't you."
"04","03","77","JULIE","Kaitlin, where are you going?"
"04","03","77","KAITLIN","To the Coens. They don't hate the whole family mom, just you."
"04","03","78","JULIE","Fine! Don't come crying to me when Kirsten's turkey tastes like rubber!"
"04","03","80","SUMMER","I'm not insane, OK? What's insane is how I used to be when all I would do was hang out with my best friend, and go tanning with her, and go shopping, and braid her hair, and talk to her on the phone..."
"04","03","80","SETH","Summer, stop. Let's be honest for a sec. That's what this is all about."
"04","03","81","JULIE","My keys..."
"04","03","82","SUMMER","I'm not running away, I just didn't realise how late it was. My dad's probably totally freaking out."
"04","03","82","SETH","I'm sorry I said it, just please don't go."
"04","03","83","JULIE","You're the one who walked away Neil. You had the affair, remember?"
"04","03","84","JULIE","Well you can talk to her all you want now. When I get back, I want you out of this house."
"04","03","84","JULIE","We'll see about that. Bye Neil."
"04","03","86","RYAN","If this is some kind of dare, I'm gonna take it..."
"04","03","86","SANDY","I trust you."
"04","03","89","SANDY","Yeah."
"04","03","89","SANDY","No, give him a minute."
"04","03","90","RYAN","You didn't try to help, you didn't even stop."
"04","03","90","RYAN","And she died. On the side of the road."
"04","03","90","RYAN","I don't wanna hear about how bad you feel. Tell me why you did it."
"04","03","90","RYAN","It matters to me."
"04","03","90","RYAN","So what? It was all an accident? A mistake?"
"04","03","90","RYAN","I'm not doing you any favors. You have to live with what you did. It's over."
"04","03","91","SANDY","I'm proud of you."
"04","03","91","RYAN","Sorry."
"04","03","91","SANDY","You hungry?"
"04","03","91","RYAN","Starving."
"04","03","91","SANDY","Well let's go. Otis, you got this?"
"04","03","91","SANDY","Alright, thanks."
"04","03","92","SUMMER","Hey. Where's my dad?"
"04","03","92","SUMMER","Kaitlin?"
"04","03","92","JULIE","Gone. (Summer sits at the table next to Julie.) We can't go on like this any more can we?"
"04","03","92","SUMMER","No."
"04","03","93","SETH","I just got her voicemail again. I'm gonna go over there."
"04","03","93","TAYLOR","I don't think you should. In fact, I am turning your ringer off."
"04","03","94","SETH","Don't. My girlfriend's freaking out."
"04","03","94","TAYLOR","That's exactly what she should be doing. Seth she needs to face what happened on her own before you can help her with it."
"04","03","95","KAITLIN","Hey. You guys your mom says you're ready for dinner."
"04","03","96","KIRSTEN","Um, Darryl, we're going to wait foe the rest of the family."
"04","03","97","SANDY","We're here."
"04","03","97","KIRSTEN","Oh, finally! (to Ryan) Are you OK?"
"04","03","97","RYAN","Yeah, I'm fine."
"04","03","98","KIRSTEN","Thank God you're home."
"04","03","98","SANDY","Honey, who... who are these gentlemen at the table?"
"04","03","98","SETH","It's a long story dad."
"04","03","98","RYAN","Sure buddy."
"04","03","98","SANDY","Hey, didn't I defend you a couple of years and for a B and E?"
"04","03","98","SANDY","Well, I'll take that as a compliment. (to Seth) An old client of mine, how do you like that?"
"04","03","98","SETH","Yeah that's pretty wild dad."
"04","03","99","KAITLIN","Ok, there's no way that this is your dog. This is little Julie."
"04","03","100","KAITLIN","OK, this can not be happening."
"04","03","100","TAYLOR","""The Lord giveth and He taketh away."" Job, 1.21. Oh but I'm no longer religious. But as a child I went to Bible school and then all of those quotes just kind of... stuck with me."
"04","03","100","KAITLIN","You are a total freakshow. (Pause.) It is so awesome."
"04","03","100","TAYLOR","Isn't it though?"
"04","03","101","SUMMER","Hey, it's me. I'm heading back to Providence. Look everything you said was true and I need to deal with it, but I need to do it on my own. I'm sorry I'm such a mess, it's just... I miss my friend. But I'll call you as soon as I get my head screwed on, OK? I love you."
"04","03","101","SUMMER","I left a message."
"04","03","101","SUMMER","Thanks for seeing me off."
"04","03","101","SUMMER","Yeah, are you gonna take that job in Seattle?"
"04","03","101","SUMMER","Is the step-monster going with you."
"04","03","101","SUMMER","I'm really sorry that you and Julie broke up."
"04","03","101","SUMMER","You know, I could take a later flight."
"04","03","101","SUMMER","Yeah. It's not too late to have Thanksgiving."
"04","03","101","SUMMER","You and me both, dad."
"04","03","102","KIRSTEN","Are we expecting somebody?"
"04","03","102","SANDY","It's cool. I'll handle it."
"04","03","103","JULIE","Hi."
"04","03","103","SANDY","Julie, whatever it is it'll have to wait. We're having Thanksgiving."
"04","03","103","JULIE","I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry."
"04","03","103","SANDY","I don't think I've ever heard you say that before."
"04","03","103","JULIE","I don't think I ever meant it."
"04","03","103","SANDY","Well, come on in."
"04","03","104","KIRSTEN","Sandy why don't you pull out a chair."
"04","03","104","JULIE","No, um..."
"04","03","106","RYAN","What?"
"04","03","106","JULIE","Anything. Just tell me about her."
"04","03","107","RYAN","I remember the first time I saw her. She was... she was wearing this white top thing, and I think she had jeans on. She was standing at the bottom of the driveway. And I thought... well that she was really hot. Really hot. She gave me a smile."
"04","03","107","JULIE","It was a beautiful smile."
"04","04","0","SUMMER","Thanks for seeing me on such short notice."
"04","04","0","SUMMER","Well, I've changed a lot since I got to college. New friends, new interests, new clothes."
"04","04","0","SUMMER","I know. But... I think throwing myself into all these new things is just a way of avoiding dealing with what happened to my friend...who, um... who died."
"04","04","0","SUMMER","Yeah, but I haven't really been grieving. Why is this happening? Life is so unfair! I'd do anything to change things. Please, just name it, and I'll do it. Nothing matters anyway. But this is so not fair! I'm sorry, I have rage issues. I think she would want me to move on. So that's what I'm going to try to do."
"04","04","0","SUMMER","It's kind of a relief in a way. Now I can go back to being me."
"04","04","0","SUMMER","Well, this whole save the planet thing, it was a crutch, right? And nothing against handicapped people, but crutches? Ew."
"04","04","0","SUMMER","Well, not me. I love shopping, tanning and celebrity gossip, always have, always will. But I think I have to. If I ever want things to be good with my boyfriend again."
"04","04","0","SUMMER","Totally."
"04","04","1","RYAN","Hey, man."
"04","04","1","SETH","Hey, dude, I know, three hour time difference, but, Ryan, she's going to dump me."
"04","04","1","RYAN","It's okay, I'm awake."
"04","04","1","SETH","Oh, good. Ryan, she's going to dump me."
"04","04","1","RYAN","No one believes that, all right? Summer loves you."
"04","04","1","SETH","The old Summer loved me. But new Summer is upon us, and Providence is the place that spawned her."
"04","04","1","RYAN","Summer is just dealing with what we're all dealing with, okay? She'll come around."
"04","04","1","SETH","What if she doesn't? This is my last shot. Otherwise, the girl with the violent temper and good hygiene is nothing but a childhood memory."
"04","04","2","SETH","Careful, lady, my girlfriend's going to be here any second."
"04","04","2","SUMMER","Shut up, Cohen."
"04","04","2","SETH","Hey, you just punched me. My baby's back."
"04","04","3","SANDY","You look good out there."
"04","04","3","RYAN","Thanks."
"04","04","3","SANDY","I got to get you on a surfboard."
"04","04","3","RYAN","Not a chance."
"04","04","3","SANDY","How about some breakfast? I could use some intel on Seth and Summer."
"04","04","3","RYAN","You know what, I can't, but, uh, I think they're doing all right. You know? Doing the long distance thing."
"04","04","3","SANDY","How about you? How are you doing?"
"04","04","3","RYAN","Good, good. Better, once I get my first day of work under my belt."
"04","04","3","SANDY","Well, Pavo Guapo is lucky to have you working there."
"04","04","3","RYAN","Me, too."
"04","04","3","SANDY","Now I got an excuse to come by for your shrimp tacos."
"04","04","3","RYAN","Yeah, Kirsten warned me about that. You're limited to two a week."
"04","04","3","SANDY","Oh! I knew I should have divorced that dame."
"04","04","3","RYAN","Well, it's not forever."
"04","04","3","SANDY","You're still accepted to Berkeley for next year. I'm just glad you're getting back to your old self. You know? Back home again. New job."
"04","04","3","RYAN","I'm just trying to stay busy and earn some extra money."
"04","04","3","SANDY","And hook me up with some shrimp tacos."
"04","04","3","RYAN","Yeah, right. I'll work on that. I'm going to walk back. I'm kind of sweaty."
"04","04","3","SANDY","Yeah, I wasn't offering you a ride. Hey, Ryan? Hang in there."
"04","04","4","SETH","Wow, that was a lot better than what I was imagining on the plane."
"04","04","4","SUMMER","You were imagining it on the plane?"
"04","04","4","SETH","Not like that. When you called me here, I was sure you were going to break up with me."
"04","04","4","SUMMER","Well, I know I'm not the one that usually apologizes in this relationship, but I'm sorry about everything. I turned into a liberal zealot just to distract myself from my own grief. I'm not even into all this stuff."
"04","04","4","SETH","So the old you is back?"
"04","04","4","SUMMER","In all of my artificially tanned glory."
"04","04","4","SETH","Thank God 'Cause I was not sure that the new you and old me were really working."
"04","04","4","SUMMER","Yeah, the new me kind of smelled weird. Well, what would you have done if I didn't go back to being me?"
"04","04","5","KIRSTEN","I checked on Ryan. Did he leave already?"
"04","04","5","SANDY","Yeah. He seemed to be doing okay. I was hoping to hang with him while Seth is away. Poker, maybe shoot a little pool, but his new job is going to make that tough."
"04","04","5","KIRSTEN","Well, I could rack a few balls with you."
"04","04","5","SANDY","You are so smart and sexy and gorgeous. But sometimes a man just needs to hang with the guys."
"04","04","5","KIRSTEN","Well, that I'm not."
"04","04","5","SANDY","You know, Jimmy left, Caleb died, then Jimmy left again. Even Neil's gone. Look, I wasn't a pennant winner, but at least I had a bullpen, you know?"
"04","04","5","KIRSTEN","It's baseball talk. I got it. Why don't you give Jason Spitz a call? You're always saying how funny he is. Why don't you ask him to do something?"
"04","04","5","SANDY","Yeah, yeah... I don't know. I mean, it's a little weird for a guy to ask another guy to do something right out of the blue like that."
"04","04","5","KIRSTEN","Since when is Sandy Cohen afraid of acting weird?"
"04","04","5","SANDY","Well, Spitz is pretty funny. He's allegedly a scratch golfer. He likes the Dodgers. I could live with that."
"04","04","5","KIRSTEN","It sounds perfect for you."
"04","04","5","SANDY","Yeah, but what am I going to do? I'm going to give him a call or what? Ask him out?"
"04","04","5","KIRSTEN","Come on. Why don't you use some of that Sandy Cohen charm? I'm sure he won't be able to resist."
"04","04","5","SANDY","It's been a long time since I been out there, honey. What if Spitzy doesn't like me?"
"04","04","5","KIRSTEN","Are you calling him Spitzy now?"
"04","04","5","SANDY","No, not yet. Do you think he'll go for it?"
"04","04","6","JULIE","Well, that's very generous of you. Thank you, Neil. Bye."
"04","04","6","KAITLIN","So how's Seattle? Is that short, sassy lady still bossing Dr. Roberts around the hospital?"
"04","04","6","JULIE","Neil is fine. He's going to let us stay in the house as long as we want."
"04","04","6","KAITLIN","Well, nice work, Mom."
"04","04","6","JULIE","I wish I could take all the credit, but it was actually Neil's idea. He's really very sweet."
"04","04","6","KAITLIN","Oh, you miss him. Well, don't worry. We'll find you another old dude to pay for all your stuff and cheat on you."
"04","04","6","JULIE","Is that what I'm teaching you?"
"04","04","6","KAITLIN","Mm, pretty much."
"04","04","6","JULIE","Well, no more. Now that we have our housing situation handled, I am officially giving up men. Good one."
"04","04","6","KAITLIN","That'll last a week, max."
"04","04","6","JULIE","I'll take that wager, young lady. And I'll make one with you. I will not so much as bat an eyelash at a man, and you will stay out of trouble."
"04","04","6","KAITLIN","You cannot live without a man. not even for a week."
"04","04","6","TAYLOR","Morning, roomies Anyone want a protein scramble?"
"04","04","6","JULIE","Nice to see you're making yourself at home, Taylor."
"04","04","6","TAYLOR","Well, thanks for making me feel at home, Jules. Summer's room is just adorable. And I don't know how I ever lived without a home gym."
"04","04","6","KAITLIN","Oh, this came for you today. Who's Henry Michael?"
"04","04","6","TAYLOR","Uh... Oh, Henri Michel? That's just, um, my French husband. I'm sure it's nothing. Excuse me."
"04","04","6","JULIE","You see? Man drama-- who needs it?"
"04","04","6","KAITLIN","Hey, Ernesto's looking pretty hot. Nice six-pack."
"04","04","6","JULIE","Where?"
"04","04","6","KAITLIN","Gotcha."
"04","04","7","RYAN","Taylor, hey."
"04","04","7","TAYLOR","Hi, Ryan. Are you working at El Pavo Guapo? You know, that means a handsome turkey?"
"04","04","7","RYAN","That's why I took the job."
"04","04","7","TAYLOR","Hey, do you know when Seth's going to be back? I really need to talk to him."
"04","04","7","RYAN","Sorry, gone for the weekend."
"04","04","7","TAYLOR","You know, that shirt really brings out your eyes."
"04","04","7","RYAN","It's black. What are you doing here, Taylor?"
"04","04","7","TAYLOR","Just in the mood for Mexican."
"04","04","7","RYAN","Mm-hmm."
"04","04","7","TAYLOR","Maybe the Macho Nacho Burrito wrap with extra guac. And... Oh, um, a favor."
"04","04","7","RYAN","No, no, no, sorry."
"04","04","7","TAYLOR","With Seth gone, you're the only one I can turn to."
"04","04","7","RYAN","Well, I'm honored."
"04","04","7","TAYLOR","Okay, so, I'm trying to get divorced, and I just found out that Henri Michel... Oh, that's my French husband. Um, he's coming to Newport and I know he's going to try and talk me out of it, and I could really use you there."
"04","04","7","RYAN","No."
"04","04","7","TAYLOR","I'm afraid to be alone with him. I'm afraid of his sensual powers. Ryan, the man is a sexual Jedi. Whatever he asks you to do, you just do it. It doesn't matter how depraved..."
"04","04","7","RYAN","Okay, some people are trying to eat here, including me someday, so..."
"04","04","7","TAYLOR","Ryan, please. If I go alone, I'll be back in France next week. You don't know how hard it was to leave. Seth and Summer are gone,my mom kicked me out, and... I have no one else. Look, just do me this one favor, and I'll leave you alone."
"04","04","7","RYAN","Promise?"
"04","04","8","SUMMER","Che, I'd like to talk."
"04","04","8","SUMMER","I haven't been completely honest with you about who I really am. This is my shoe collection. There's leather, suede, and the occasional calfskin boot."
"04","04","8","SUMMER","These are my magazines. I know which stars pump gas just like us, and who's on pump watch. And this is Marissa. She was my best friend, um, but she died in a car accident on graduation night."
"04","04","8","SUMMER","Yeah, well, it's so heavy that I couldn't deal, so... I put all my energy towards being an activist, but that's not who I am. These shoes and these magazines-- that's me, but I hope we can still be friends."
"04","04","8","SETH","Hey. I put some cream in your coffee. I figured you'd be back on dairy."
"04","04","8","SUMMER","Hey, uh, Che, this is my boyfriend, Seth. Seth, this is Che."
"04","04","8","SETH","Oh, hey. Uh, where I come from, we just say hey."
"04","04","8","SUMMER","Thanks, Che."
"04","04","8","SETH","What's that?"
"04","04","8","SUMMER","It's garbage."
"04","04","9","SANDY","Hi, Jason. How you doing?"
"04","04","9","SANDY","Oh, the slowest talker in the world. It took forever. Forever."
"04","04","9","SANDY","Hey, uh... you got any plans this weekend?"
"04","04","9","SANDY","No, no, I didn't mean that. I'm just saying that we could, you know, you and I, uh, we could do something."
"04","04","9","SANDY","Poker, pool, you know, a little small ball. If you're free. If not, no worries."
"04","04","9","SANDY","Oh, sure, yeah. Whatever."
"04","04","10","SUMMER","God, this is so disgusting."
"04","04","10","SETH","I don't know, I think you're being too hard on April. Derek's knee was... it was really messed up."
"04","04","10","SUMMER","No, I just... I don't like this show anymore. All they do is create fake problems for fake people just to distract viewers from the real problems in the world."
"04","04","10","SETH","Well, I don't think the network would go for a sexy teen soap set in the Damascus, but we can turn it off if you want. I just thought you liked it."
"04","04","10","SUMMER","I'm just distracted. I haven't been keeping up on how much blow Lindsay Lohan's doing. And did you hear about JT and Cameron?"
"04","04","10","SETH","No, what?"
"04","04","10","SUMMER","I don't know. That is the point. I'm going to go get one of my magazines."
"04","04","10","SETH","That sounds like the old Summer. I'm going to stay here and, uh, keep watching. You know, I have this thing where if I start something, I have to finish. Is that like a disease or a condition?"
"04","04","10","SUMMER","Don't really know, Cohen. I'm reading about who got lipo."
"04","04","11","RYAN","You know, you might want to relax."
"04","04","11","TAYLOR","Distract me. Tell me about this, um, cage fighting. It's something that I've been meaning to get into."
"04","04","11","RYAN","Yeah? Yeah? Ask me another favor, I'll be happy to show you."
"04","04","11","TAYLOR","Oh, Ryan Atwood with a side of sauce. I like it. You're going to have to do better, though, 'cause right now all I ca think of is him, my husband, and his arms, his smell... making love in the barn in Burgundy."
"04","04","11","RYAN","Sounds like the perfect guy. Why would you want to divorce?"
"04","04","11","TAYLOR","Well, despite being agnostic in most things, I do believe in true love. And this was not it. Well, back to you and your life. What is your favorite fruit?"
"04","04","11","RYAN","Peaches."
"04","04","11","TAYLOR","Oh, he used to say my breasts were like two, soft..."
"04","04","11","RYAN","Is that him?"
"04","04","11","TAYLOR","No, that's... his lawyer."
"04","04","11","RYAN","Is everything okay?"
"04","04","11","TAYLOR","No, not exactly."
"04","04","11","RYAN","What did he say? What's wrong? What's going on?"
"04","04","11","TAYLOR","Oh, I just told him you were a soccer fan."
"04","04","11","RYAN","Oh. Yeah, I like soccer."
"04","04","12","SETH","Sorry today was such a bust."
"04","04","13","SETH","Well, you threw your smoothie at a lady on the street."
"04","04","13","SUMMER","Hey, that fur did not look faux."
"04","04","13","SETH","Yeah, I just feel like your mind is someplace else."
"04","04","13","SUMMER","My mind is on this adorable sweater right here. I'm going to try it on' with that bag we bought, because how cute would they look together? Now, if you don't mind, a little privacy."
"04","04","13","SETH","Well, I enjoy watching you take off your clothes, I'm sure I'll enjoy watching you put them on."
"04","04","13","SUMMER","Hey, this is a very intense process."
"04","04","13","SETH","All right, actually this is perfect. I wanted to head over to Thayer Street and do a walking tour of ethnic foods. I can't be moving here if the shwarma is not up to par."
"04","04","13","SUMMER","Well, bring me a kabob."
"04","04","13","SUMMER","Che, hey, I wanted to know how the rally went."
"04","04","13","SUMMER","Oh, that sounds great."
"04","04","13","SUMMER","Trying on a sweater. Hey, Seth and I are going to watch a movie here later if you want to come by."
"04","04","13","SUMMER","Debate?"
"04","04","13","SUMMER","Uh, well, tell everyone I said hi, and good luck."
"04","04","13","SUMMER","Huh? Like what?"
"04","04","13","SUMMER","No."
"04","04","14","KIRSTEN","So you're really giving up on men?"
"04","04","14","JULIE","Men are to me, what Chardonnay is to you. One sip and I'm upside down on a chandelier."
"04","04","14","KIRSTEN","Not that you've ever done that. What's your point, Julie?"
"04","04","14","JULIE","I'm just trying to set a good example for Kaitlin, develop my own interests, maybe my career, that is, if you'd still have me as a partner."
"04","04","14","KIRSTEN","As I told you, New Matchis there for you whenever you want."
"04","04","14","JULIE","Thanks, Keeks. I was hoping you'd say that. Okay, so, I have so many new ideas about expanding. I went online. I checked out some office... Oh, there's Taryn."
"04","04","14","KIRSTEN","Wow, she looks amazing. Did she have some work done?"
"04","04","14","JULIE","She's had something."
"04","04","14","KIRSTEN","Oh, it's Sandy. Excuse me. Hi, honey."
"04","04","14","SANDY","Hey, guess what?"
"04","04","14","KIRSTEN","I'm not good at guessing."
"04","04","14","SANDY","I'm going out."
"04","04","14","KIRSTEN","I'm jealous, with who?"
"04","04","14","SANDY","Spitz! Spitzy to me."
"04","04","14","KIRSTEN","He called?"
"04","04","14","SANDY","He called."
"04","04","14","KIRSTEN","How about that? How about that?"
"04","04","14","SANDY","Maybe a little golf, maybe a drink after, watch the game."
"04","04","14","KIRSTEN","Golfing, game watching, suddenly not so jealous."
"04","04","14","JULIE","Really? I didn't know you were seeing anyone."
"04","04","14","JULIE","Oh, so grateful, and limber."
"04","04","14","JULIE","Uh, I'm trying to be a role model."
"04","04","14","KIRSTEN","Did Taryn run off already? Mm-hmm. What's she doing?"
"04","04","14","JULIE","Him."
"04","04","15","KAITLIN","Yeah. I think I'll pass."
"04","04","15","KAITLIN","Well, where is he going?"
"04","04","15","KAITLIN","Look, you guys, I made a bet with my mom that I'd stay out of trouble. And this definitely sounds like trouble."
"04","04","15","KAITLIN","Well, with a foolproof plan like that, how can I say no?"
"04","04","16","TAYLOR","Garcon?"
"04","04","16","RYAN","Ah! Taylor ! It's been a few hours since your last Macho Nacho. You must be starving."
"04","04","16","TAYLOR","I was thinking of the mol. And, um, one more tiny little favor."
"04","04","16","RYAN","Does it involve me standing around while you speak French? 'Cause I've already done that."
"04","04","16","TAYLOR","No, no, no. I actually just need your signature. You see, before I can get divorced, I have to have someone attest to my character."
"04","04","16","RYAN","That's in French."
"04","04","16","TAYLOR","It's just the usual boilerplate. You know, never been to prison- well, me, not you. Never been married before, no contact with livestock, blah, blah, blah. So I think I have a pen."
"04","04","16","RYAN","Uh, you know, actually, can I sign that after work? Just leave it here."
"04","04","16","TAYLOR","Sure. Yes, okay. Thank you very much. So you don't speak French at all?"
"04","04","16","RYAN","No, why?"
"04","04","16","TAYLOR","Well, it must have been really boring for you today. Sorry."
"04","04","17","SETH","Hey, I got some extra baba ghanoush."
"04","04","17","SETH","I'm all right. Where's Summer? I gave her a little time-out. It's not easy having house guests."
"04","04","17","SETH","Honestly, it could have gone a little better. I mean, you know, I support her, whatever she's into, but I really need this to work 'cause..."
"04","04","17","SUMMER","The people have spoken! We are of one voice, one mind and one heart! Yeah! I will not sleep, I will not eat, I will not rest until this hypocrisy ends. Solar panels on all of our dormitories, or we revolt!"
"04","04","18","RYAN","Hey, man, how's your French?"
"04","04","18","SETH","Old Summer's been replaced by the real Summer, and she looks suspiciously like the new Summer."
"04","04","18","RYAN","So she's still in her ""Go Green"" phase?"
"04","04","18","SETH","I don't think it's a phase, man. I think this is her life now, and it's obvious I don't fit in it. Uh, sorry, gotta go."
"04","04","19","SUMMER","Didn't mean to eavesdrop."
"04","04","19","SETH","It's okay."
"04","04","19","SUMMER","Well, I knew you were lying last night when you said nothing was wrong."
"04","04","19","SETH","Nothing is wrong; you're doing what people do at college-- discovering who you really are."
"04","04","19","SUMMER","Believe me, I am as surprised as you are. But I'm still going to shave my legs and wash my hair, and be the best girlfriend that I can."
"04","04","19","SETH","Well, you know, who can ask for more than that?"
"04","04","19","SUMMER","Think of all the new subjects we'll have to talk about."
"04","04","19","SETH","I did explain the concept of recycling to you in tenth grade."
"04","04","19","SUMMER","See, there's lots of places where we could use your help, Cohen."
"04","04","20","SETH","Hey... Oh! You're really nude. Why don't I... let me come back."
"04","04","20","SETH","Wow. Wow. That's really, uh... Anyways, listen, I kind of need your help."
"04","04","20","SETH","Oh, hey, that's cool, we can shake. We can shake. We can shake. And we're touching."
"04","04","21","SANDY","Oh! Fore!"
"04","04","21","SANDY","Rob, what are you doing?"
"04","04","21","SANDY","Oh, sorry."
"04","04","21","SANDY","No, no, no! You're up. I'll play it from the parking lot."
"04","04","21","SANDY","Who does? Who's got the time?"
"04","04","21","SANDY","Well, when we were kids, all you had to do was ask, hey, want to play some ball? And we didn't have any cell phones."
"04","04","21","SANDY","Oh! I'm so sorry, man! I'm so sorry. It's the office. I'm turning it off."
"04","04","22","KIRSTEN","I love this space and I love the windows."
"04","04","22","JULIE","Plus it's by the beach, so there'd be lots of foot traffic and eye candy, not that I'm looking."
"04","04","22","KIRSTEN","So I'll make an appointment for us for Monday? Are you doing anything tonight?"
"04","04","22","JULIE","No, Kaitlin's with the twins, working on a science project, so I have the night all to myself."
"04","04","22","KIRSTEN","Well, Sandy's out with a friend. Do you want to do something? I don't know-- takeout and a movie?"
"04","04","22","JULIE","Two women spending Saturday night at home together. I love it. How very Whatever Happened To Baby Jane."
"04","04","22","KIRSTEN","Go ahead, you can take it."
"04","04","22","JULIE","No, that's okay. Just a sec. Hello?"
"04","04","22","JULIE","Uh, actually, I'm here with Kirsten and we were thinking about maybe..."
"04","04","22","JULIE","I'll call you back."
"04","04","22","KIRSTEN","Oh, I was just going to get some takeout menus. Do you know what you'd like to eat?"
"04","04","22","JULIE","Kirsten, I feel like I'm coming down with something. I'm not feeling so hot. Do you mind if I take a rain check on our girl's night in?"
"04","04","22","KIRSTEN","Julie, did you just put on lipstick?"
"04","04","22","JULIE","What? No, uh... I'm just a little flushed. I'll call you."
"04","04","23","KAITLIN","Okay, I think that's the guy."
"04","04","23","KAITLIN","Okay, you guys just stay here. Money. Got what we talked about?"
"04","04","23","KAITLIN","You think it's my first buy? It's been a pleasure."
"04","04","23","KAITLIN","That's heinous."
"04","04","24","JULIE","I don't know about this, Taryn. It might be too soon."
"04","04","25","TAYLOR","Ryan! There you are. You know, I think there might be something wrong with your phone. I called you three times today."
"04","04","25","RYAN","Six, actually."
"04","04","25","TAYLOR","Oh, well, um, did you get a chance to look at that silly little document?"
"04","04","25","RYAN","Yeah! I did. And I had a question for you. Um, what does that mean?"
"04","04","25","TAYLOR","Oh, that's just lawyer speak. You know, just party of the first part, party of the second part."
"04","04","25","RYAN","So it doesn't say we had s*x, like, 30 times? Took me like five hours to translate that."
"04","04","25","TAYLOR","Sorry."
"04","04","25","RYAN","Yeah."
"04","04","25","TAYLOR","It's just that without the consent of my husband, the only way I can get a divorce is if one of us was unfaithful. I just didn't think you'd sign if you knew the truth."
"04","04","25","RYAN","Yeah, well, I've got a lot of half-eaten enchiladas to clear."
"04","04","25","TAYLOR","Ryan, I have to meet that lawyer at the yacht club tonight, and if I don't have this signed, I'm going to have no choice but to go with him to France and try to work it out with Henri Michel, face-to-face."
"04","04","25","RYAN","Which means you won't be able to keep coming here, which is a real shame."
"04","04","25","TAYLOR","Well, did you at least read this part where I said what a great lover you are?"
"04","04","25","RYAN","Look, Taylor... this job, this is about all I can handle right now. You know?"
"04","04","25","TAYLOR","I shouldn't have dragged you in to this."
"04","04","25","RYAN","Yeah, that's what I've been trying to say."
"04","04","25","TAYLOR","It's just that I...don't have anyone else. It's kind of why I married a Frenchman in the first place. I mean, my mom hates me. I don't really know my dad, and last year was the first year I ever had friends. All of a sudden, I'm by myself in a foreign country, and I meet this guy who says he loves me. He wants to take care of me and... and... One too many bottles of Chateau Margot and a view from the Eiffel Tower, and why not? That's how Tom wooed Katie. Why not me?"
"04","04","25","RYAN","Well, look, I'm sorry you're going through all this. I'm just not the guy to help. Sorry."
"04","04","26","SUMMER","Here they come. There you are."
"04","04","26","SETH","Did you know that the amount of solar energy that touches the Earth's surface in 40 minutes is greater than all the energy required by the entire human population in a year?"
"04","04","26","SUMMER","Yes, I did know that."
"04","04","26","SETH","Uh, no... But I made this."
"04","04","26","SUMMER","Can you just make an exception? It's for the good of the Earth."
"04","04","26","SETH","Well, it's cool, you go ahead."
"04","04","26","SUMMER","But it's your last night here. You can't spend it alone."
"04","04","26","SETH","Summer, everybody in there is counting on you, okay? I can amuse myself for a few hours."
"04","04","26","SUMMER","You're the best boyfriend ever."
"04","04","26","SETH","Go change the world."
"04","04","27","SANDY","Looks like you're going to get a chance to meet one of my kids. Hey, Ryan."
"04","04","27","RYAN","Hey."
"04","04","27","SANDY","I'd like you to meet Jason Spitz from work."
"04","04","27","RYAN","What's up? How you doing?"
"04","04","27","SANDY","We're about to go in and watch the game, get a bite to eat. Can you join us?"
"04","04","27","RYAN","Uh, you know, actually, I'm kind of beat. But you guys go ahead. Nice to meet you."
"04","04","27","SANDY","I'll be inside. Yeah. Is everything okay? 'Cause I'm guessing not really."
"04","04","27","RYAN","I didn't get fired, I didn't punch any of my drunken customers, I'd say I'm great."
"04","04","27","SANDY","One day at a time, one foot in front of the other. Eventually, it'll get easier."
"04","04","27","RYAN","Yeah, why, because I'll start to forget about her?"
"04","04","27","SANDY","No, no. You're never going to forget about her. But... life goes on."
"04","04","27","RYAN","Not the same life."
"04","04","27","SANDY","No. But you're going to have to make this life work."
"04","04","27","RYAN","Yeah, but I do, you know? I got a job. I go there, I go home. I talk to as few people as possible."
"04","04","27","SANDY","If it were only that easy. Unfortunately for you, getting mixed up in other people's lives, helping them out of jams, it seems to be what you do, like it or not. I'd hate to see you turn your back on that. It'd be like rning your back on yourself. Come on, join us, would you? Get a little food, watch the second half of the game."
"04","04","27","RYAN","Actually, there's something I've got to do. Uh, you guys have fun."
"04","04","27","SANDY","All right."
"04","04","27","RYAN","All right."
"04","04","28","KAITLIN","Let me do the talking, okay?"
"04","04","28","KAITLIN","Cool."
"04","04","28","KAITLIN","I'm sorry, is there a problem with their I.D.'s? Because they're with me."
"04","04","28","KAITLIN","See you guys later."
"04","04","29","SANDY","This is great. Watching the game, having a beer. For five minutes, the sky isn't falling. A chance to be stupid again."
"04","04","29","SANDY","Hey, honey."
"04","04","29","KIRSTEN","How's it going?"
"04","04","29","SANDY","Great. Spitz just told me a story about how his kid's walked in on him and his wife when they were playing Strip Scrabble."
"04","04","29","KIRSTEN","Strip Scrabble? I'm glad things are going well."
"04","04","29","SANDY","Yeah. So how are you doing? You having fun with Julie?"
"04","04","29","KIRSTEN","Well, Julie had a mysterious illness. So I'm home alone. I just finished watching a movie and I thought I'd check in. I love you."
"04","04","29","SANDY","I love you. Bye."
"04","04","30","TAYLOR","I don't love him. I never did. I was just scared."
"04","04","30","RYAN","Sorry I'm late. You have that paper for me to sign?"
"04","04","30","TAYLOR","Ryan, I..."
"04","04","30","RYAN","Don't worry about it."
"04","04","31","SUMMER","Hey, sleepyhead."
"04","04","31","SETH","Hey."
"04","04","31","SUMMER","Hey."
"04","04","31","SETH","Did we win?"
"04","04","31","SUMMER","Not yet, but Che suggested a filibuster, so it could go on all night. I think we got 'em."
"04","04","31","SETH","That's great."
"04","04","31","SUMMER","Yeah. When I showed them my cost benefit analysis chart, jaws actually dropped."
"04","04","31","SETH","Of course they did. There's all these old people in there that are actually listening to me. Me! It felt better than when I got 70% off that Marc Jacobs dress with the broken zipper."
"04","04","31","SETH","I wish I could have been there."
"04","04","31","SETH","I'm totally fine. Listen, go back in there and knock it out of the park."
"04","04","31","SUMMER","Was that a sports reference?"
"04","04","31","SETH","Maybe. See, I know people can change."
"04","04","32","RYAN","Yeah?"
"04","04","32","TAYLOR","Oh, I'm sorry. Were you asleep?"
"04","04","32","RYAN","No."
"04","04","32","TAYLOR","Oh, well, then my timing is impeccable, as always. So I wanted to thank you. So I made you peach torte. Yeah, after I got married, Henri Michel made me take a cooking class. Um, I failed everything except tortes. Tortes I rocked."
"04","04","32","RYAN","Uh, well, that's great, but, um..."
"04","04","32","TAYLOR","You're not a dessert guy. Okay. Well, um, I could make you lunch, or... dinner. I have to pay you back somehow."
"04","04","32","RYAN","I love dessert."
"04","04","32","TAYLOR","Okay. Fork."
"04","04","32","RYAN","Thanks."
"04","04","32","TAYLOR","Yeah? All right. Wow. Who would have thought, six months ago, you and I, sitting here, sharing a torte."
"04","04","32","RYAN","Not me."
"04","04","32","TAYLOR","You know, at graduation, in my commencement address, I said there's no one older than a high school senior, no one younger than a college freshman. It was one of the few parts that wasn't in Latin. And uh, it's true. Because I feel like everything I thought I knew, everything that I expected, is just kind of gone out the window."
"04","04","32","RYAN","Yeah, life is definitely unpredictable."
"04","04","32","TAYLOR","Yeah. But I guess I'm realizing that that could be a good thing. You know? Because it's exciting not knowing what's going to happen."
"04","04","32","RYAN","Taylor, this is a great torte. Really good."
"04","04","33","SETH","Can I have the next flight to John Wayne Airport, please?"
"04","04","33","SETH","Come on."
"04","05","0","RYAN","What are you doing up?"
"04","05","0","SETH","I had a dream Summer was marrying Ralph Nader and I was playing the marimba at the wedding."
"04","05","0","RYAN","Good gig. Why don't you call her?"
"04","05","0","SETH","I'm giving her space, remember? I promised myself I'd wait at least a week before calling. What are they dancing about?"
"04","05","0","RYAN","This guy just saw his girlfriend's ankle. Hmm. You think it's about time to talk to someone?"
"04","05","0","SETH","Nobody ever died of insomnia. Fine. You know what? I'm sort of in the mood for a chaste Hindu love story with lots of needless dancing."
"04","05","0","RYAN","Seth, go to bed."
"04","05","0","SETH","No can do. If you're awake, I'm awake."
"04","05","1","SETH","Nice."
"04","05","1","KIRSTEN","Thank you. You know, you'd be a lot sharper if you didn't sleep on the couch."
"04","05","1","SETH","You know, maybe you should invest in some less-comfortable furniture. Why don't you chew on that for a while?"
"04","05","1","SANDY","Morning, all."
"04","05","1","KIRSTEN","Hey, how'd it go?"
"04","05","1","SETH","Oh. I'll get it."
"04","05","2","KIRSTEN","Oh, they are so lucky that you are organizing that event. You are amazing."
"04","05","2","SANDY","Mm... Uh-huh. What do you need?"
"04","05","2","KIRSTEN","I just need a slogan for New Match. So far, your son has come up with ""Love is Nice,"" and ""Love Schmov."""
"04","05","2","TAYLOR","""Love is a smoke made with the fumes of sighs; being purged a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes."""
"04","05","2","KIRSTEN","Taylor, that's beautiful."
"04","05","2","TAYLOR","Shakespeare. Old Bill's always good or a line. Julie left this in my car. So, um, I was in the neighborhood, I thought I'd drop it by in case you needed it."
"04","05","2","KIRSTEN","Oh, thank you. I'm going to go give Ryan some coffee."
"04","05","2","TAYLOR","Um, I can do that."
"04","05","2","KIRSTEN","Thank you."
"04","05","3","RYAN","Hello?"
"04","05","3","TAYLOR","Easy, girl."
"04","05","3","RYAN","Taylor, what are you doing here?"
"04","05","3","TAYLOR","Um, I'm just, uh, bringing Kirsten some papers. This is for you."
"04","05","3","RYAN","Oh, thanks, but actually, I'm kind of not drinking coffee right now."
"04","05","3","TAYLOR","Oh. Well, Ryan, I just wanted to thank you again for helping me with my husband, and I am..."
"04","05","3","RYAN","You don't have to pay me back."
"04","05","3","TAYLOR","Are you kidding? If it wasn't for you, I would be in France right now, trapped in a loveless marriage. You saved my life, and I am at your command. Anything you want... anything."
"04","05","3","RYAN","You could hand me that shirt."
"04","05","3","TAYLOR","You joker. Here. Um, I'm serious. You're not getting out of this so easily. You know, in some cultures,they say that if you save someone's life,you're bound to them forever. Bye."
"04","05","4","SANDY","Here she comes."
"04","05","4","TAYLOR","You know, it's odd, but I never appreciated how funny Ryan is. Life-- such a journey. Well, have a nice day."
"04","05","4","SANDY","She said Ryan was funny."
"04","05","5","JULIE","Oh, my God ! Wake up! Wake up!"
"04","05","6","KAITLIN","Are you my new daddy?"
"04","05","6","KAITLIN","Oh, really? How much do you charge for that?"
"04","05","6","KAITLIN","Save it, okay? If my mom wants to club five nights a week, sleep till noon, and hook up with some 25-year-old Bavarian beefcake, it just means she's got less time for me. The door is that way, Hans."
"04","05","6","JULIE","Kaitlin... You are having breakfast alone?"
"04","05","6","KAITLIN","Yeah, why? Who else would be here?"
"04","05","6","JULIE","No one. Uh, although my new personal trainer was going to come over. You know, we single women have to stay in shape."
"04","05","6","KAITLIN","Well, I'm sure he'll give you a very good workout."
"04","05","7","SETH","Oh, no."
"04","05","7","TAYLOR","Seth! Good, you're here."
"04","05","7","SETH","Actually, I was just, I was..."
"04","05","7","TAYLOR","You might want to sit down. I have huge news and a favor to ask you."
"04","05","7","SETH","You like Ryan and you want my help convincing him to date you?"
"04","05","7","TAYLOR","Wow."
"04","05","7","SETH","You said he was funny; that's kind of a giveaway."
"04","05","7","TAYLOR","I know, it's crazy. I mean, I've always thought ""Cute guy, might be good for a night of rough-and-tumble fun, but it's not like we have anything in common."""
"04","05","7","SETH","So ignore it. It's probably just gas."
"04","05","7","TAYLOR","But then when he helped me with my husband and he kissed me, it was like Dorothy landing in Oz. Everything just popped into Technicolor."
"04","05","7","SETH","Ah."
"04","05","7","TAYLOR","You think I don't know what that means?"
"04","05","7","SETH","I said, ""Ah."""
"04","05","7","TAYLOR","Meaning, ""Ah, that Taylor, she is so pathetic. Someone's the least bit nice to herand she becomes totally obsessed with them. First me, and then her French husband when he lent her a subway ticket, now Ryan."
"04","05","7","SETH","Well, you know, isn't it kind of true?"
"04","05","7","TAYLOR","So what? Yes, I have a psychological predilection to become romantically attached to men who are nice to me due to the fact that I was raised by a she-wolf of a mother who practiced emotional terrorism. Does that mean that if by some miracle, love does come into my life,I should deny it? What kind of person would that make me? What kind of life..."
"04","05","7","SETH","Taylor, what do you want me to do?"
"04","05","7","TAYLOR","Find out if he's ready to start dating."
"04","05","7","SETH","Okay."
"04","05","8","RYAN","Hello?"
"04","05","8","SETH","Hey, you're doing a great job."
"04","05","8","RYAN","Thanks."
"04","05","8","SETH","Did you finish the movie last night?"
"04","05","8","RYAN","Uh-huh. Uh, which one?"
"04","05","8","SETH","Are you ready to date again?"
"04","05","8","RYAN","What?"
"04","05","8","SETH","Simple question."
"04","05","8","RYAN","I have no idea. Why?"
"04","05","8","SETH","Okay, cool."
"04","05","9","SETH","He's not sure. Listen, you don't want to get involved with him right now, okay? He slept like four hours in the last week. He's a mess."
"04","05","9","TAYLOR","Really? Interesting."
"04","05","10","SUMMER","What's this one's name?"
"04","05","10","SUMMER","Yes, Lou, we should go."
"04","05","11","KAITLIN","I stopped eating ice cream."
"04","05","11","KAITLIN","Nonfat, non-dairy yogurt."
"04","05","11","KAITLIN","Okay. But if I serve this one in, you have to go out with me."
"04","05","11","KAITLIN","So a kiss is still out of the question?"
"04","05","11","JULIE","Well, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to squeeze me in for a training session tonight. Mm-hmm. Easy girl. Hold on a second."
"04","05","11","JULIE","Kaitlin, you didn't tell me you had a new instructor. Hi, I'm Julie Cooper, Kaitlin's mother."
"04","05","11","JULIE","Oh, no, I used to, but... I was actually thinking about getting back into it."
"04","05","12","KIRSTEN","Hey. You're early."
"04","05","12","SANDY","Well, I wanted to see the new place up and running... and give you this. So Julie already took off, huh?"
"04","05","12","KIRSTEN","She had to pick up Kaitlin at tennis. Oh, it's a Wonder Woman paperweight."
"04","05","12","SANDY","Seth gave me his employee discount."
"04","05","12","KIRSTEN","Well, it may end up being a souvenir."
"04","05","12","SANDY","What are you talking about?"
"04","05","12","KIRSTEN","Remember that woman that I told you about in Laguna that has a high-end dating service?"
"04","05","12","SANDY","Yeah, she's going to retire, sell you her client list."
"04","05","12","KIRSTEN","Well, she got another offer, four times ours,and right now we don't have enough money to counter, which means that all of this could be short-lived."
"04","05","12","SANDY","What about taking on a backer?"
"04","05","12","KIRSTEN","I could you put in touch with the donors I've been talking to."
"04","05","12","SANDY","I'm playing golf tomorrow with Gordon Bullet."
"04","05","12","KIRSTEN","The oil tycoon?"
"04","05","12","SANDY","Yeah."
"04","05","12","KIRSTEN","Didn't he go to jail for tax evasion?"
"04","05","12","SANDY","Yeah, but he's out now. I had dinner with him last month. He's really not a bad guy for being a total pig."
"04","05","12","KIRSTEN","I don't know. We just wanted to do this ourselves. And besides, having a silent partner, they always have an opinion."
"04","05","12","SANDY","Well, it's my impression he's got a lot of fish to fry. So I doubt he'd be involved in your day-to-day, but I could ask him."
"04","05","12","KIRSTEN","Okay. Thanks."
"04","05","13","SUMMER","Did you find out what they were doing with them?"
"04","05","13","SUMMER","What's the plan again?"
"04","05","13","SUMMER","Lead them, how?"
"04","05","13","SUMMER","Your flute? Like the Pied Piper?"
"04","05","13","SUMMER","Hi. You're a fat bunny. You're name is Pancakes. Did you know that? Huh? Pancakes. Hey, come here."
"04","05","13","SUMMER","Yeah."
"04","05","13","SUMMER","Come on, Pancakes."
"04","05","14","RYAN","Taylor?"
"04","05","14","TAYLOR","Ryan, you can't sleep, can you? You poor thing."
"04","05","14","TAYLOR","Seth told me everything. But lucky for you, junior year, I won the state science fair for my study in sleep disorders. I can help you."
"04","05","14","RYAN","Oh, well, that's really nice, but actually, you know,I'm fine."
"04","05","14","TAYLOR","It's the middle of the night, and you're wide awake."
"04","05","14","RYAN","So are you."
"04","05","14","TAYLOR","Well, I never sleep more than four hours a night. It's unproductive. Ryan, don't you see, this is how I'll pay you back."
"04","05","14","RYAN","Yeah. You know what? Actually, I'm kind of tired."
"04","05","14","RYAN","Fine."
"04","05","14","TAYLOR","Ryan?"
"04","05","14","RYAN","Yeah?"
"04","05","14","TAYLOR","Good night."
"04","05","14","RYAN","Good night, Taylor."
"04","05","15","TAYLOR","Okay, just relax. Be normal. You can do this. Good morning, Ryan."
"04","05","15","RYAN","Hi."
"04","05","15","TAYLOR","Oh, you poor thing. You look exhausted."
"04","05","15","RYAN","Yeah, well, look, Taylor, I don't know what Seth told you, but I'm fine, really. I've got work, so..."
"04","05","15","TAYLOR","Did you sleep at all last night?"
"04","05","15","RYAN","No, but, uh..."
"04","05","15","TAYLOR","And how about the night before? Ryan, insomnia can go on for months. What's the harm in letting me try and help you?"
"04","05","15","RYAN","Fire away."
"04","05","15","TAYLOR","Okay. So, um, first off... How much of this is related to Marissa? I'm really sorry to ask, but if that's what's going on, I think we need to know. Well, I need to know."
"04","05","15","RYAN","It's not about her. It started after Thanksgiving."
"04","05","15","TAYLOR","Hmm. Right after Volchok turned himself in?"
"04","05","15","RYAN","Yeah, I guess, why?"
"04","05","15","TAYLOR","Ryan, I'm just spit-balling here..."
"04","05","15","RYAN","Yeah, yeah."
"04","05","15","RYAN","I hadn't thought about that."
"04","05","15","TAYLOR","Oh, my God. I am such an awesome sleep therapist. And this is only our first session."
"04","05","15","RYAN","Yeah, listen, I better go."
"04","05","15","TAYLOR","Yes."
"04","05","15","RYAN","But, uh, thanks. This was, uh... Good."
"04","05","15","TAYLOR","Well, my pleasure. Bye."
"04","05","16","JULIE","Thank you, Spencer."
"04","05","16","KAITLIN","You know, this is supposed to be my tennis lesson."
"04","05","16","JULIE","Don't you think it's fun to do mother-daughter stuff?"
"04","05","16","KAITLIN","Please."
"04","05","16","JULIE","Do you mind? It's the third time."
"04","05","16","KAITLIN","Sorry."
"04","05","16","JULIE","I think I really strained it. I'm strong."
"04","05","16","JULIE","Ooh, perfect. Where's my racket?"
"04","05","16","KAITLIN","Oh, that's weird. You know, I'm ready when you are."
"04","05","17","GORDON","Well, I get that she did a fine job in that whole Middle East thing, but I'm sorry, Madeline Albright-- not hot."
"04","05","17","SANDY","Well, Gordon..."
"04","05","17","GORDON","I told you to call me Bullet."
"04","05","17","SANDY","Well, Bullet, call me crazy, but maybe Madeline Albright doesn't need to be hot."
"04","05","17","GORDON","Oh, well, that's an interesting point of view, Sandy."
"04","05","17","SANDY","Hey, your donation to the PD's Outreach Program was really generous, thank you."
"04","05","17","GORDON","Oh, well, you caught me at the right time. I was in bed with those Arab fellas. That's a metaphor. Them boys cooked the books on me, so I sold out. Left them high and dry. They never should have messed with old Bullet. Bang. All righty. Look at that. Shii-ite Muslim. You see, the point is, I'm cash-rich right now, and I don't know what to do with all the stuff."
"04","05","17","SANDY","Really?"
"04","05","17","GORDON","Cigar?"
"04","05","17","SANDY","No, thanks."
"04","05","17","GORDON","They're Cuban. Commie bastards do one thing right."
"04","05","17","SANDY","You know, my wife just started a business, and she and her partner are thinking about taking on investors. In fact, you could talk to them about it tomorrow at the benefit-- you know, get the details."
"04","05","17","GORDON","Well, I don't think I'm going tomorrow, Sandy. You see, my date went back to her husband."
"04","05","17","SANDY","I'm going to do you a favor. You should talk to my wife,because that's the business she's in, and her partner is newly single."
"04","05","17","GORDON","She hot?"
"04","05","18","SETH","And I was into recycling way before it was cool. Al Gore got half that stuff from a paper I wrote in sixth grade. I just don't, you know, make a stink, because he's doing good work."
"04","05","18","RYAN","Well, when are you allowed to call Summer again?"
"04","05","18","RYAN","No, no."
"04","05","18","TAYLOR","Hi, Seth. Ryan, I need your keys. I have to get your room ready."
"04","05","18","SETH","What?"
"04","05","18","TAYLOR","Oh, I'm Ryan's sleep therapist."
"04","05","18","RYAN","Right. Uh, that's your tacos."
"04","05","18","SETH","Because you can't."
"04","05","18","TAYLOR","Why not? I did not tell you about Ryan's sleep problems, so you could use it for some weirdo seduction. I'm not..."
"04","05","18","SETH","Are you a sleep therapist? Are you certified? Sleep ther... Do you have a little certificate from the American Institute of... uh, the sleep place?"
"04","05","18","TAYLOR","And what if I can help him? He wins, I win. They call it win-win for a reason."
"04","05","18","SETH","It doesn't matter. You can't."
"04","05","18","TAYLOR","Just say what you're really thinking, Seth."
"04","05","18","RYAN","Hey... Everything okay?"
"04","05","18","SETH","Yeah."
"04","05","18","TAYLOR","Great."
"04","05","18","SETH","Could you go get me some pico de gallo?"
"04","05","18","RYAN","Yeah. Sure."
"04","05","18","TAYLOR","It's true-- you don't think I'm good enough."
"04","05","18","SETH","That's crazy."
"04","05","18","TAYLOR","Oh, Taylor, she's so funny, what a kook,but her and Ryan, please."
"04","05","18","SETH","You need help, do you know that?"
"04","05","18","TAYLOR","I mean, she's no Marissa. Exactly."
"04","05","18","RYAN","Here you go."
"04","05","18","SETH","Thanks, I've got to get back to the shop."
"04","05","18","TAYLOR","Yeah, I better go, too."
"04","05","19","SUMMER","Hey, Amber. Did Seth...""?"
"04","05","19","SUMMER","Uh... he is. It doesn't mean that I can't call him."
"04","05","19","SUMMER","Seth isn't doing that."
"04","05","19","SUMMER","What? Did they say what for?"
"04","05","19","SUMMER","Huh, really? Well, maybe someone thought it was inhumane."
"04","05","19","SUMMER","Che."
"04","05","19","SUMMER","What are you going to do?"
"04","05","19","SETH","Breathe, caterpillar. It's all going to be okay. I went through the same exact thing when they tried to frame me for flooding the trustee dinner."
"04","05","19","SUMMER","But you did floodthe trustees' dinner."
"04","05","19","SUMMER","I don't think I can lie."
"04","05","19","SUMMER","But, Che, what if they kick us out?"
"04","05","19","SUMMER","Pancakes."
"04","05","20","KAITLIN","In a minute. I just want him to see me in my bikini first."
"04","05","20","KAITLIN","All right, shut up. I have real feelings for this guy... Oh, my God."
"04","05","21","RYAN","Oh, my God."
"04","05","21","TAYLOR","Welcome home, Ryan."
"04","05","21","RYAN","Taylor. Taylor, Taylor. This, um... Are you wearing pajamas?"
"04","05","21","TAYLOR","Oh, yes. Many people sleep better with a warm body beside them. Don't worry. It's completely non-sexual."
"04","05","21","RYAN","Yeah. I've got to ask, though. Is this... I mean, you don't, you don't like me, do you?"
"04","05","21","TAYLOR","Um... Yeah, I like you. We're friends."
"04","05","21","RYAN","No, I mean, the, um..."
"04","05","21","TAYLOR","Oh. Oh... My goodness, no. No, no, no, no, no. I just, you know, I want to pay you back and, um... I happen to be really interested in sleep disorders."
"04","05","21","RYAN","Okay."
"04","05","21","TAYLOR","Great. Shall we start with a massage?"
"04","05","22","SETH","Oh! Whoa! What the...? Hey, what are you doing here?"
"04","05","22","TAYLOR","Me? What are you doing here?"
"04","05","22","SETH","Uh, bringing Ryan coffee, and I live here. Did you stay the night?"
"04","05","22","TAYLOR","No. Well, yeah, kind of. Can I just have one of these? You didn't put any sweetener in, did you? 'Cause I read that aspartame can cause brain tumors quicker than you can say Jack Robinson. Hey."
"04","05","22","SETH","Taylor."
"04","05","22","TAYLOR","I was just helping Ryan with his sleep. Have you seen him? He was gone when I woke up."
"04","05","22","RYAN","Hey! I went for a jog. It's, uh, this isn't what it looks like."
"04","05","22","TAYLOR","Totally. Yeah, you know... Well, kind of. We did sleep in the same bed."
"04","05","22","RYAN","No, actually, uh, you slept in the bed. I was reading in the chair all night."
"04","05","22","SETH","This is too weird for this early in the morning. I'm just going to... here."
"04","05","22","RYAN","Well, that was good."
"04","05","22","TAYLOR","So you really didn't sleep at all? Is it because I snored? My mom always wanted me to get an operation for a deviated septum."
"04","05","22","RYAN","You didn't snore."
"04","05","22","TAYLOR","We should talk about what happened so I can adjust the plan for tonight."
"04","05","22","RYAN","Taylor, look, I appreciate everything you've done. I really do. And I think you're probably right about Volchok. But I also think it's something I need to go through on my own. So let's call it even, okay?"
"04","05","22","TAYLOR","Okay."
"04","05","22","RYAN","All right. I'm going to go jump in the pool."
"04","05","23","KAITLIN","You going on a date?"
"04","05","23","JULIE","Yes, I'm going to Sandy's delinquent benefit with a man called ""The Bullet."" Apparently, he owns Texas."
"04","05","23","KAITLIN","Oh, well, that sounds like fun. Um, do you think Mr. Cohen would mind if I crashed?"
"04","05","23","JULIE","Yeah, I think that'd be okay. I'll have to leave you some cab money."
"04","05","23","KAITLIN","Well, what if I invited a friend who drives?"
"04","05","23","JULIE","That works, too. It's nice to see you interested in charity."
"04","05","23","KAITLIN","That's me."
"04","05","24","SUMMER","I helped free the bunnies. I didn't know that they were only being studied for how they interacted. I know it doesn't excuse it."
"04","05","24","SUMMER","No, I'm sorry."
"04","05","24","SUMMER","I wasn't involved in that."
"04","05","24","SUMMER","Dean, other deans, I really, really love Brown. I have changed so much here. But I'm afraid if I tell you who did those other things, then I'd be betraying the new me, and I can't do that."
"04","05","24","SUMMER","I don't know anything about that."
"04","05","25","KAITLIN","Taylor, did you take my lip gloss with the bee pheromones in it?"
"04","05","25","TAYLOR","It's on the dresser."
"04","05","25","KAITLIN","Are you okay?"
"04","05","25","TAYLOR","Yeah, peachy."
"04","05","25","KAITLIN","Talk."
"04","05","25","TAYLOR","Okay, what do you do when you like a boy and he barely knows you're alive and you already pretended to be his sleep therapist and... I'm out of options?"
"04","05","25","KAITLIN","Okay. Well, this may sound a little weird, but try dressing up fabulous and going to a place where you know you'll run into him."
"04","05","25","TAYLOR","That's it?"
"04","05","25","KAITLIN","That's it."
"04","05","25","TAYLOR","That really works?"
"04","05","25","KAITLIN","Almost every time. And I mean,touching his arm when you guys are talking is always good and dancing and body contact. And laugh at his jokes. I mean, even if they're not that funny."
"04","05","25","TAYLOR","Ooh, I-I do that already. Okay, what else?"
"04","05","25","KAITLIN","You could walk in front of him, I mean, if he's a butt guy."
"04","05","25","TAYLOR","I don't know if he's a butt guy."
"04","05","25","KAITLIN","Well, it can't hurt. I mean, girl, you've got a great butt."
"04","05","25","TAYLOR","You are such a sweetie. Tell me more."
"04","05","26","SANDY","I just want to thank you again on behalf of the entire Public Defender's Office. So please, drink, dance and have a great time. Thank you."
"04","05","27","SANDY","Hello."
"04","05","27","KIRSTEN","This is wonderful."
"04","05","27","SANDY","Thank you. So how's Julie and The Bullet doing?"
"04","05","27","KIRSTEN","See for yourself."
"04","05","27","GORDON","So there was this big, white-tailed Texas deer coming across there, so I wheel around like Dick Cheney and go... bang! I got him. Bang!"
"04","05","28","TAYLOR","Hello, Ryan."
"04","05","28","RYAN","Taylor, hi. You look, um..."
"04","05","28","TAYLOR","I look nice?"
"04","05","28","RYAN","Nice, yeah, that's the word I was looking for."
"04","05","28","TAYLOR","Well, so do you. Would you like to dance?"
"04","05","28","RYAN","Actually, I'm not much of a dancer. It's probably shocking."
"04","05","28","TAYLOR","Maybe the exercise will tire you out. Not that this is therapy. No, we're not doing that anymore. It's just, you know, fun."
"04","05","28","RYAN","Yeah, okay."
"04","05","28","TAYLOR","Okay."
"04","05","29","JULIE","Whew. Okay, just a second. He wants to talk numbers Monday."
"04","05","29","KIRSTEN","Who?"
"04","05","29","JULIE","The Bullet. He's getting drinks. But he's in, Kiki. He loves New Match."
"04","05","29","KIRSTEN","That's great."
"04","05","29","JULIE","I know."
"04","05","29","KAITLIN","Mom."
"04","05","29","JULIE","Kaitlin."
"04","05","29","KAITLIN","Look at who I brought with me."
"04","05","29","JULIE","What are you doing here?"
"04","05","29","KIRSTEN","Uh, Julie, what's going on?"
"04","05","29","KAITLIN","Is that your date?"
"04","05","29","JULIE","You and I will talk later. Bullet, this is..."
"04","05","29","GORDON","What the hell are you doing here, boy?"
"04","05","29","JULIE","You know each other?"
"04","05","29","JULIE","What?"
"04","05","29","KAITLIN","What?"
"04","05","29","KIRSTEN","Oh, God."
"04","05","30","SANDY","You ditching my party already?"
"04","05","30","SANDY","Sorry, Seth. I'd say, yeah, that'd be cheating. Hey, did I see Taylor leaving the pool house this morning?"
"04","05","30","SETH","Yeah, she's pretending to be Ryan's sleep therapist so he falls in love with her. That's new."
"04","05","30","SANDY","That'd explain the way they're dancing in there. I hope it works out."
"04","05","30","SETH","You're supporting this seduction plot?"
"04","05","30","SANDY","Well, you don't have to be a shrink to see that Ryan's still working through things. You know, I think he could use the human connection."
"04","05","30","SETH","Yeah, but those two... I don't know."
"04","05","30","SANDY","Well, they're not the most obvious couple, but then neither were you and Summer once upon a time. And Taylor thinks Ryan is funny."
"04","05","31","RYAN","We-we did not hate you."
"04","05","31","TAYLOR","Oh, you totally hated me. Come on, you were probably the president of the ""We Hate Taylor Club."""
"04","05","31","RYAN","I was the secretary. I took the notes."
"04","05","31","TAYLOR","Ryan, you made a real joke."
"04","05","31","RYAN","Yeah, well, a pretty bad one. But I made a real joke. Thank you, but don't tell anyone. You want a drink?"
"04","05","31","TAYLOR","That'd be nice."
"04","05","32","SETH","I saw you dancing with Taylor."
"04","05","32","RYAN","Yeah, is that look supposed to mean something or...?"
"04","05","32","SETH","Crazier things have happened. Nothing I can recall this instant, but..."
"04","05","32","RYAN","Okay, I don't think so. Ask yourself why."
"04","05","32","SETH","She's smart, she's funny."
"04","05","32","RYAN","Dude, just forget about it, okay? I'm not going to date Taylor."
"04","05","32","TAYLOR","Um, I was just... Excuse me."
"04","05","33","RYAN","Taylor, Taylor, Taylor... Hold on, let me explain."
"04","05","33","TAYLOR","Oh, I think you were pretty clear, Ryan. And, yes, I lied when you asked me if I liked you. But... What was I even thinking? I mean, you and me... I must be totally crazy."
"04","05","33","RYAN","You're not crazy, okay?"
"04","05","33","TAYLOR","Ryan, I pretended to be a sleep therapist to seduce you."
"04","05","33","RYAN","That was crazy."
"04","05","33","TAYLOR","Don't worry, because I'm sure next week I'll be totally obsessed with some guy who gives me change for parking."
"04","05","33","RYAN","Look, what I said has absolutely nothing to do with you, okay? It's just..."
"04","05","33","TAYLOR","What? That for the longest time all you could feel was your desire to kill Volchok,now that's gone,so you feel empty. You can't feel anything, least of all anything for me."
"04","05","33","RYAN","How do you keep doing that?"
"04","05","33","TAYLOR","Doing what?"
"04","05","33","RYAN","That-- you keep telling me what I'm thinking before I feel it."
"04","05","33","TAYLOR","Because I think about you. You know, I want you to be happy, and I think that if you gave it a chance, you might feel something, too."
"04","05","33","RYAN","Taylor..."
"04","05","33","TAYLOR","Are you going to tell me that you really like me as a friend?"
"04","05","33","RYAN","Maybe. How does she do that?"
"04","05","34","JULIE","Do you have any idea what you just did in there?"
"04","05","34","KAITLIN","Screwed up things with your new boyfriend? Thought you were all, ""I'm off men. I'm going to start focusing on the new business."""
"04","05","34","JULIE","That was about business, Kaitlin. That man was going to give us money, money that we need."
"04","05","34","KAITLIN","Then why'd you have to hook up with Spencer? I mean, couldn't you see that I liked him?"
"04","05","34","JULIE","He's ten years older than you, and no, I couldn't see that."
"04","05","34","KAITLIN","Well, I was flirting with him."
"04","05","34","JULIE","You flirt with everybody."
"04","05","34","KAITLIN","So do you."
"04","05","34","JULIE","You're 15 years old."
"04","05","34","KAITLIN","And you're my mother. I don't have to see guys sneaking down the stairs while I'm trying to eat breakfast. It makes me want to barf. That..."
"04","05","34","JULIE","That is completely fair. Oh, my God, honey. What is wrong with me? I am so sorry."
"04","05","34","KAITLIN","It's okay. Just try to pick one guy. One that I don't like."
"04","05","34","JULIE","How did you know that Spencer was Bullet's son?"
"04","05","34","KAITLIN","I didn't."
"04","05","34","JULIE","It was just coincidence? That's weird."
"04","05","35","SUMMER","Waiting for you. Have you been talking to the board this whole time?"
"04","05","35","SUMMER","Are you kidding? Che, there would be no political activism at Brown without you. Oh, my God, are you getting kicked out?"
"04","05","35","SUMMER","What?"
"04","05","35","SUMMER","What did you tell them, Che?"
"04","05","35","SUMMER","Well, Che, you did all of those things and I protected you."
"04","05","35","SUMMER","Shut up about the movement, okay? This is not Cuba. We are in college. We have dining cards. I'm going to get kicked out."
"04","05","35","SUMMER","No, okay, don't call me that. Okay, just stay away from me."
"04","05","36","GORDON","Well, fine. Fine. You'll have your money tomorrow. Senators. Well, if it's not the little pot stirrer. Have you seen my idiot son? He's probably somewhere banging his head against the wall."
"04","05","36","KAITLIN","Dude, no one cares that he's your son. You should invest in my mother's business."
"04","05","36","GORDON","Or what? You going to tell everyone what a meanie old Bullet is and I'm going to have to sit alone at lunch? Oh, boo-hoo, boo-hoo."
"04","05","36","KAITLIN","My mother is awesome. She ran the Newport Group. And when she broke up with her fiancee, she got his house. She'll make you a lot of money."
"04","05","36","GORDON","Already got a lot of money, squirt."
"04","05","36","KAITLIN","Just thought it might be some fun. Well, if that's all you're in for, then knowing my mother, will be the best investment you've ever made."
"04","05","37","KIRSTEN","Tired?"
"04","05","37","SANDY","Exhausted. Hey, how'd it go with the Bullet?"
"04","05","37","KIRSTEN","Well, as it turns out, Julie was dating his 25-year-old son."
"04","05","37","SANDY","Ooh. That's a weird coincidence."
"04","05","37","KIRSTEN","That about sums it up."
"04","05","37","GORDON","Sandy, mind if I borrow your wife for a second? Come on, blondie, I won't bite."
"04","05","38","JULIE","Hey, you ready to go home?"
"04","05","38","KAITLIN","Yeah. Where's Spencer? I figured you guys would have made up and he'd be showing you his half volley."
"04","05","38","JULIE","I told him it's over and that if he ever came near you again, I would crush him."
"04","05","38","KIRSTEN","Julie? We're back on. Bullet wants to come by the office on Monday."
"04","05","38","JULIE","What?"
"04","05","38","KIRSTEN","Apparently Kaitlin can be quite persuasive. I'll talk to you tomorrow."
"04","05","38","KAITLIN","Yeah, I got game."
"04","05","38","JULIE","You want to get some ice cream?"
"04","05","38","KAITLIN","I stopped eating. What the hell. The guy at the ice cream store is so hot."
"04","05","38","JULIE","That's my girl."
"04","05","39","SETH","Well, close enough."
"04","05","39","TAYLOR","Seth."
"04","05","39","SETH","Taylor, what are you doing in here?"
"04","05","39","TAYLOR","When I had really bad insomnia last year,a Chinese doctor gave me this herbal tea. And I thought it might help Ryan sleep. I would have given it to him before, but I was trying to seduce him."
"04","05","39","SETH","So... So why can't you just give it to him?"
"04","05","39","TAYLOR","Because I'm too embarrassed. You were totally right. Here I am, getting a divorce, I'm living like a refugee at Julie's. Ryan's nice to me so I fall for him ? It's just totally pathetic. Just please give that to him."
"04","05","39","SETH","Wow, I never thought I'd see you quitting."
"04","05","39","TAYLOR","Well, it's completely hopeless, Seth. You heard him."
"04","05","39","SETH","Yeah, I know, just you're rolling over like an old dog. Not the Taylor I remember."
"04","05","39","TAYLOR","Are you seriously trying to Jedi mind trick me?"
"04","05","39","SETH","Taylor Townsend, quitter. I guess I'll just have to get used to that."
"04","05","39","TAYLOR","Fine."
"04","05","40","SETH","Hello."
"04","05","40","SUMMER","Hey."
"04","05","40","SETH","Hey. Summer, I was just about to call you."
"04","05","40","SUMMER","Oh, you were?"
"04","05","40","SETH","Yeah."
"04","05","40","SUMMER","I wanted to call you, but I didn't want to seem needy."
"04","05","40","SETH","Are you kidding? I been wanting to call you all week."
"04","05","40","SUMMER","Seth, you still love me, right?"
"04","05","40","SETH","Of course I do. What's going on?"
"04","05","40","SUMMER","Well... I got a rabbit."
"04","05","40","SETH","Okay. What's its name? Wait, no, let me guess. Is it Cyclotron?"
"04","05","40","SUMMER","No."
"04","05","40","SETH","Are you lying? Is it, uh, Gorgon the Destroyer of Carrots?"
"04","05","40","SUMMER","No."
"04","05","40","SETH","Is it Larry?"
"04","05","40","SUMMER","Larry? You're not Larry."
"04","05","41","TAYLOR","Um, I brought you some tea. I'm not trying to be your therapist again. I just thought it might help you sleep."
"04","05","41","RYAN","Oh, thanks."
"04","05","41","TAYLOR","Oh, God, what am I doing."
"04","05","41","RYAN","Wait, hold on. Look, I've got to say something. I think you've got this idea that you're this strange person that has to trick people into liking you. That's not true. You're, um... You're amazing."
"04","05","41","TAYLOR","Oh, my God. You just did it to me."
"04","05","41","RYAN","Did what?"
"04","05","41","TAYLOR","You said exactly what I was feeling. Well, except for the amazing part."
"04","05","41","RYAN","Well, it's true. Honestly, you know, I wish I did feel something."
"04","05","41","TAYLOR","Kiss me."
"04","05","41","RYAN","Uh, what?"
"04","05","41","TAYLOR","I think there's something there. And I think that if you kiss me you'll feel it, too."
"04","05","41","RYAN","I think we already did that."
"04","05","41","TAYLOR","Nope, uh-uh. You kissed me, I didn't kiss you. Come on. Just... If you don't feel anything, I will never mention it again. That's the best deal you'll ever get. Ask Seth. Just one kiss. One kiss. One kiss."
"04","05","41","RYAN","Okay."
"04","05","41","TAYLOR","Okay. I'm sorry."
"04","05","42","SUMMER","Thanks for talking to me, Cohen. I really miss you."
"04","05","42","SETH","Get some sleep, I'll talk to you tomorrow."
"04","05","42","SUMMER","I love you."
"04","05","42","SETH","I love you, too."
"04","05","43","SETH","Hey, I figured you'd be up."
"04","06","0","SANDY","Hey, Ryan? Ryan? I shmeared it for you."
"04","06","0","RYAN","Thanks."
"04","06","0","SANDY","Is everything okay?"
"04","06","0","RYAN","Yeah. I'm just gonna go see if Seth's up."
"04","06","0","SETH","I am up, and I'm out of here."
"04","06","0","RYAN","What? Where you going?"
"04","06","0","SANDY","I didn't know you were planning a trip."
"04","06","0","SETH","Neither did Summer, but RISD sent my dorm info, so I figured I'd check out my new home and give her some moral support for finals. Are you gonna eat that?"
"04","06","0","KIRSTEN","Are you sure that's such a good idea?"
"04","06","0","RYAN","Why, did Ryan do something to it?"
"04","06","0","KIRSTEN","No, not the bagel,the trip."
"04","06","0","SANDY","I thought you were gonna give Summer some more space."
"04","06","0","SETH","Well, a little space turned into a lot of missing me. That's my cab. E-mail me a Christmukkah list. I'm gonna be shopping at the Providence Place Mall. They have carpeting, which is weird. They have a Dave & Buster's, but parking sucks."
"04","06","0","RYAN","Listen, dude, I really need to talk to you-- it's very important."
"04","06","0","SETH","Okay, and I want to hear all about it when I land in Providence. Just call me. Call me."
"04","06","1","SUMMER","Suspended?"
"04","06","1","SUMMER","But I have finals, and friends."
"04","06","1","SUMMER","But my dad is living in Seattle with the step-monster. And Taylor Townsend is sleeping in my old bed. And Seth was moving out here so we could be together."
"04","06","1","SUMMER","This is my home."
"04","06","2","SUMMER","It's just you and me now."
"04","06","2","SUMMER","Yep. Sounds like your plan worked out perfectly."
"04","06","2","SUMMER","Oh, Che, just shut up, okay? Before I tie you up with hemp rope, set you on fire, and get high off the fumes from your burning flesh."
"04","06","2","SUMMER","Mm."
"04","06","2","SUMMER","Yeah, Che, you have. You got me thrown out of school. You know, I really liked this place. I liked who I was becoming at it. I mean, this was my life."
"04","06","2","SUMMER","I just wanted to be a student. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to find my roommate and tell her that she now has a single."
"04","06","3","KIRSTEN","Are you dirty, Ryan? Ryan? Hello?"
"04","06","3","RYAN","Hey."
"04","06","3","KIRSTEN","I-I couldn't help but notice that you wanted to talk to Seth."
"04","06","3","RYAN","Oh, did I?"
"04","06","3","KIRSTEN","Well, since he's out of town and he's gonna be moving out next semester, you're gonna need a new Seth. Don't tell Sandy, but... I thought I would audition for the job."
"04","06","3","RYAN","Oh, uh, yeah, well, that's, uh, very thoughtful."
"04","06","3","KIRSTEN","So... how does it work? Do I ask you what's on your mind?"
"04","06","3","RYAN","Uh, usually you talk about yourself, and I solve my problems on my own."
"04","06","3","KIRSTEN","I couldn't help but notice that you've been spending time with Taylor."
"04","06","3","RYAN","Rea... Have I?"
"04","06","3","KIRSTEN","If we're gonna talk about girls, I am a far more knowledgeable resource than my son."
"04","06","3","RYAN","Okay. But you can't repeat this, all right?Because if the real Seth found out I was telling the substitute Seth a real secret..."
"04","06","3","KIRSTEN","It's in the vault."
"04","06","3","RYAN","Okay. I kissed Taylor. Or she kissed me. Anyway, there was a kiss, and, uh..."
"04","06","3","KIRSTEN","And now you can't stop thinking about her."
"04","06","3","RYAN","Pretty much."
"04","06","3","KIRSTEN","That is so cute."
"04","06","3","RYAN","Okay, Seth never does that."
"04","06","3","KIRSTEN","Sorry. But it is, and so is she."
"04","06","3","RYAN","Yeah, I know, it's just... me and Taylor?"
"04","06","3","KIRSTEN","After everything you've been through over the last few months, if something good happens, shouldn't you embrace it? Or at least be open to the possibility?"
"04","06","3","RYAN","You're right. You're right. Thanks."
"04","06","3","KIRSTEN","Okay. So do I get the job?"
"04","06","3","RYAN","You're on the short list."
"04","06","4","KAITLIN","Spencer, what brings you to Casa de Cooper?"
"04","06","4","KAITLIN","You restrung it for me. That's so sweet."
"04","06","4","KAITLIN","Good, because I've been having a lot of stress lately. I could use a little bit of... relaxing."
"04","06","4","KAITLIN","Well, now that you and my mom are over, maybe you can help me with my stroke."
"04","06","4","KAITLIN","Lame."
"04","06","4","KAITLIN","You mean boys?"
"04","06","4","KAITLIN","I don't know, maybe..."
"04","06","5","TAYLOR","Hi, Ryan."
"04","06","5","RYAN","I got to go, can't talk."
"04","06","5","TAYLOR","I'm-I'm not hereto see you. I'm just covering for Seth while he's gone."
"04","06","5","RYAN","That's nice."
"04","06","5","TAYLOR","Sorry that I kissed you."
"04","06","5","RYAN","What? No, its... it's cool."
"04","06","5","TAYLOR","It's obviously not okay. You're totally uncomfortable around me now."
"04","06","5","RYAN","No, no. Um... It's... the kiss is not a problem."
"04","06","5","TAYLOR","Really? Good, because usually when I kiss a guy, it ends in tears. His, not mine, because, like,I'm a bit of a lip biter and, you know, sometimes I draw blood and..."
"04","06","5","RYAN","Taylor?"
"04","06","5","TAYLOR","Yeah?"
"04","06","5","RYAN","What are you doing tonight?"
"04","06","5","TAYLOR","Oh, I'm updating my blog. It's kind of Felicity by way of Anais Nin, the erotic memoirs of a soulful college girl."
"04","06","5","RYAN","Taylor, tonight, are you busy?"
"04","06","5","TAYLOR","Oh. Blog, shmog."
"04","06","5","RYAN","Is-is that a yes?"
"04","06","5","TAYLOR","Yes, it is a yes, squared. In all caps, with a exclamation mark and a smiley-faced emoticon."
"04","06","5","RYAN","A simple yes will do."
"04","06","5","TAYLOR","Yes. Great, all right, well, I'll see you tonight. Hey, do you just want to come up to the comic book store? There's a flat-screen TV, SurroundSound, a bevy of Blu-ray anime."
"04","06","5","RYAN","All right. See you then."
"04","06","6","KAITLIN","Hey, Eric."
"04","06","6","KAITLIN","It seems like people at this school like to watch hairless wonders in banana slings. I'm just trying to fit in."
"04","06","6","KAITLIN","Do you bitches have a problem?"
"04","06","6","KAITLIN","I know that his brother shaves his chest."
"04","06","6","KAITLIN","Gayer than his dad, I know."
"04","06","6","KAITLIN","Yes."
"04","06","6","KAITLIN","Cool. Do you guys think anyone would notice if I sparked a jay by the bleachers?"
"04","06","6","KAITLIN","Okay, why do you guys let her talk to you like that?"
"04","06","6","KAITLIN","So don't go."
"04","06","6","KAITLIN","'Kay, well, if you guys change your minds, I'll be by the bleachers."
"04","06","7","RYAN","Hey, man, how's the East Coast treating you?"
"04","06","7","SETH","Too soon to tell. I had a layover in Salt Lake and then I got delayed in Poughkeepsie. It's hard to get a direct flight last minute."
"04","06","7","RYAN","Yeah, well, at least you made it. Summer surprised to see you?"
"04","06","7","SETH","I'm headed over there right now. I got an all-night study package. I scored a brick of Dunkin' Donuts coffee and some reasonably priced meth from this homeless guy. Oh, I'm sure she'll appreciate the pick-me-up, very thoughtful. How are things with you ? I know you wanted to talk."
"04","06","7","RYAN","Things are weird. And about to get a lot weirder."
"04","06","7","SETH","That wasn't vague or ominous at all."
"04","06","7","RYAN","I'll explain later."
"04","06","8","RYAN","Back at you."
"04","06","9","KIRSTEN","I know you're unhappy, but you've been out with seven different men."
"04","06","9","JULIE","This is Newport. You live in a monkey cage, you have to date chimps."
"04","06","9","KIRSTEN","I appreciate the analogy, but, Pam, how do we fix this?"
"04","06","9","KIRSTEN","Her prayers have been answered."
"04","06","9","GORDON","I tell you, the women are well-preserved in this town. If my slacks weren't so damn tight..."
"04","06","9","JULIE","Bullet, what are you doing here? I thought you were going to be a silent partner."
"04","06","9","GORDON","Oh, I ain't here to work. I came to see my girlfriend."
"04","06","9","JULIE","What? No, I am not..."
"04","06","9","GORDON","Car's waiting outside. Dinner's planned. I'd invite Blondie, but she don't look much like an eater."
"04","06","9","KIRSTEN","Oh, that's a shame. I'm going to let you two figure this out. See you in the morning."
"04","06","9","JULIE","Kirs... Okay, I'm not having dinner with you. You repulse me, and I'm busy."
"04","06","9","GORDON","Well, that's cool; busy doing what?"
"04","06","9","JULIE","A client is unhappy with our man base, so I have to go on a major recruiting mission."
"04","06","9","GORDON","Or you can just put them in the Bullet's line of fire."
"04","06","9","JULIE","Okay, while the client is looking for something out of the norm, ""lunatic"" probably isn't her type."
"04","06","9","GORDON","Have dinner with me."
"04","06","9","JULIE","No."
"04","06","9","GORDON","A cocktail?"
"04","06","9","JULIE","No!"
"04","06","9","GORDON","Then let's just make out."
"04","06","9","JULIE","I can hurt you."
"04","06","9","GORDON","Wow. Call me."
"04","06","10","TAYLOR","Isn't this just great? I mean, did you ever think that decapitation could be so beautiful?"
"04","06","10","RYAN","How many times have you seen this?"
"04","06","10","TAYLOR","Oh, I watch it every night. It helps relax me. Is everything okay?"
"04","06","10","RYAN","I'm sorry."
"04","06","10","TAYLOR","So that's a ""no."""
"04","06","10","RYAN","I can't do this."
"04","06","10","TAYLOR","Okay, um... I've done my fair share of misreading signs in my life, but you asked me to hang out. You sat next to me, you leaned in with a slight tilt of your head."
"04","06","10","RYAN","I know, I know, and I'm sorry. Uh, you're a great girl. It's just, this is too weird."
"04","06","10","TAYLOR","Well, that makes me feel so much better."
"04","06","10","RYAN","Me! Not you, me ! I'm... weird."
"04","06","11","SUMMER","Surprise! Cohen? Cohen."
"04","06","11","SETH","Hey, where are you?"
"04","06","11","SUMMER","Where are you?"
"04","06","11","SETH","I'm in your room."
"04","06","11","SUMMER","I'm in your room."
"04","06","11","SETH","Summer, I was going to surprise you."
"04","06","11","SUMMER","Well, I'm surprised."
"04","06","11","SETH","Yeah, me, too. Why aren't you in school?"
"04","06","11","SUMMER","Because I got kicked out."
"04","06","11","SETH","Summer, what'd you do?"
"04","06","11","SUMMER","I listened to stupid Che and his stupid plan, and he sold me down the stupid river."
"04","06","11","SETH","I knew anyone that sincere was not to be trusted."
"04","06","11","SUMMER","I miss it already. I don't know what to do."
"04","06","11","SETH","Yeah, well, I do."
"04","06","11","SUMMER","What?"
"04","06","11","SETH","If he hurt you, then I'm going to hurt him."
"04","06","11","SUMMER","That's funny, Cohen. See, I knew you could cheer me up."
"04","06","11","SETH","I'm serious. You can at least act like it's halfway feasible that I could avenge your honor."
"04","06","11","SUMMER","What, you're serious? No, no, no."
"04","06","11","SETH","I'm going to go so Ryan Atwood on his ass."
"04","06","11","SUMMER","Come on, Cohen, I don't like this."
"04","06","11","SETH","Neither will Che."
"04","06","11","SUMMER","No, wait, don't..."
"04","06","12","SANDY","So Kirsten told me she came in yesterday and applied for the job of substitute Seth."
"04","06","12","RYAN","She may have."
"04","06","12","SANDY","Well, you know, uh, if anyone's qualified, I think we all know it's me, and I'm thinking the only reason you didn't ask me is because no interview was necessary."
"04","06","12","RYAN","Yeah, well, it turns out I may not have to fill the position I handled the whole Taylor thing although it may be a little awkward for a while."
"04","06","12","SANDY","Oh. What happened?"
"04","06","12","RYAN","Nothing happened. Which was the problem for her."
"04","06","12","SANDY","Yeah, yeah."
"04","06","12","RYAN","But now I don't know. I mean, at first I thought I was just caught up in the whole Volchok thing. And then I thought the problem might've been Taylor. You know, because she canbe a little, uh, weird."
"04","06","12","SANDY","She's a touch eccentric."
"04","06","12","RYAN","But now I think the problem is me. Maybe it's too soon."
"04","06","12","SANDY","So keep it casual. You know, just tell her you... you need to be friends for now."
"04","06","12","RYAN","Yeah, that's a line every girl loves to hear."
"04","06","12","SANDY","No, if it's the truth, she'll understand."
"04","06","12","RYAN","Well, I don't have any other choice. All right, I'll give it a shot."
"04","06","12","SANDY","Great, okay, listen, if there's anything else I can do for you, I'll be in my room reading comics and listening to indie rock."
"04","06","12","RYAN","All right. That was a good Seth."
"04","06","13","SUMMER","Were you a good Ryan?"
"04","06","13","SETH","I was actually going to borrow one from the Julie Cooper playbook, and wait till Che was asleep, then smother him with a pillow."
"04","06","13","SUMMER","Oh, my hero."
"04","06","13","SETH","But the guy was at some all-night candlelight vigil. Still, he's got to sleep sometime. This place reeks of incense and righteousness."
"04","06","13","SUMMER","Oh, that's Che's musk. Look, be careful."
"04","06","13","SETH","He's not in his room. Neither was your roommate last night."
"04","06","13","SUMMER","Yeah, that's because she's a huge slut."
"04","06","13","SETH","Wait a minute, what's this?"
"04","06","13","SUMMER","What, I don't know. I'm on the phone, I can't see. Hello, Seth."
"04","06","13","SUMMER","Is that Che? What's happening?"
"04","06","13","SUMMER","Peace ? He's going to run? That coward!"
"04","06","13","SETH","I'm going to watch it again for background noise, visual cues, anything that might tip me off to his whereabouts."
"04","06","13","SUMMER","No, Cohen, Che has had survival training, okay. He's probably hiding in a cave somewhere with Osama Bin Laden. Look, forget about him. I need you, and I'm here."
"04","06","13","SETH","All right, but for the record, I did not back down."
"04","06","13","SUMMER","And I love you for it. Come home."
"04","06","13","SETH","Okay."
"04","06","14","JULIE","Summer? What are you doing here?"
"04","06","14","SUMMER","Oh, I slept out here. Turns out I like nature. And Taylor's in my bed."
"04","06","14","JULIE","No, I mean, what are you doing here in Newport?"
"04","06","14","SUMMER","Oh. Long story."
"04","06","14","JULIE","Oh. Well, then if you need anything or just want to talk, I'm here for you."
"04","06","14","SUMMER","Thanks, Julie."
"04","06","14","JULIE","And you should go reclaim your bedroom. Taylor has boundary issues."
"04","06","14","SUMMER","Mm."
"04","06","14","JULIE","Is that a bunny?"
"04","06","15","KAITLIN","You guys can all come to my party. It's tonight, my house."
"04","06","15","KAITLIN","Bring whoever you guys want. And don't worry about any lame costumes."
"04","06","15","KAITLIN","Oh, it will be."
"04","06","16","JULIE","You want to join New Match? I don't understand."
"04","06","16","KIRSTEN","The application fee is rather steep, and most of our female clients are over 35."
"04","06","16","JULIE","Uh-huh, and I think I know who it is."
"04","06","16","GORDON","Bang! Am I good or am I good?"
"04","06","16","JULIE","What do you think you're doing?"
"04","06","16","GORDON","Well, money may not buy love or happiness, but it'll buy a whole lot of bachelors. I think you owe me a weekend as a thanks."
"04","06","16","JULIE","No, I can't. I already have plans."
"04","06","16","GORDON","Cancel them."
"04","06","16","JULIE","I'm going away for the weekend with Kirsten and Sandy. To the Montage, it's their anniversary."
"04","06","16","GORDON","You're celebrating their anniversary?"
"04","06","16","JULIE","They're having a recommitment ceremony and, uh... I am their witness."
"04","06","16","GORDON","Well, that's the sweetest thing I've ever heard. See you there."
"04","06","16","KIRSTEN","The Bullet?"
"04","06","17","RYAN","Taylor."
"04","06","17","TAYLOR","Ryan. Boo! Didn't run away that time, so you must not be that scared of me."
"04","06","17","RYAN","All right, look, I just wanted to come by and apologize about last night, and... And I didn't know you had company."
"04","06","17","TAYLOR","Roger, Ryan. Ryan, Roger."
"04","06","17","RYAN","Roger."
"04","06","17","TAYLOR","Ryan. I've been helping Roger track down this obscure Kinji Fukasaku biography. And it turns out he watches Blood Bath IV every night before he goes to bed, too."
"04","06","17","RYAN","Well, that's..."
"04","06","17","TAYLOR","Kismet? I know. Maybe it's too soon to talk about fate, but..."
"04","06","17","RYAN","Yeah, well, anyway, I just wanted, you know, to see if you need a ride home or anything."
"04","06","17","RYAN","Not you."
"04","06","17","TAYLOR","Well, that is very friendly of you, Ryan, since I'm assuming that's what you want us to be, just friends?"
"04","06","17","RYAN","Well, if you're cool with that."
"04","06","17","TAYLOR","Ryan Atwood, ""mon ami"" sounds terrif. But Roger and I were just gonna hang out and, uh, order some takeout, so if you don't mind."
"04","06","17","RYAN","All right, well, uh, you know, I'll see you, then."
"04","06","17","TAYLOR","Bye, friend."
"04","06","17","RYAN","Bye, Roger."
"04","06","17","TAYLOR","Let's come look at this. I wanted to show you this. I really think you guys should work at this one."
"04","06","18","SUMMER","Yeah, I talked to my dad today. He was pretty disappointed in me."
"04","06","18","SETH","Well, I'm leaving the Antelope Valley Airport now, so there's just the $100 cab ride home."
"04","06","18","SUMMER","Just get here soon, okay?"
"04","06","18","SETH","Okay, I love you."
"04","06","18","SUMMER","That was fast."
"04","06","19","KAITLIN","What, or convince her to let me throw a huge party with underage drinking? Yeah, I have to get her out of the house. Are you going somewhere?"
"04","06","19","JULIE","yeah, I'm go to the Montage with Sandy and Kirsten, just for the weekend."
"04","06","19","KAITLIN","Going to a hotel with Sandy and Kirsten? They're not spicing their relationship up, are they?"
"04","06","19","JULIE","Please, Sandy and Kirsten?"
"04","06","19","KAITLIN","Yeah, they don't exactly scream threesome."
"04","06","19","JULIE","Just how old are you? So I guess I can assume you'll be fine without me this weekend?"
"04","06","19","KAITLIN","Oh, I think I can survive."
"04","06","19","JULIE","Now, if you need anything, Summer and Taylor are in charge."
"04","06","19","KAITLIN","Wait, Summer's here?"
"04","06","19","SUMMER","Fine, Che, you're really going to dehydrate, camp out on the front lawn, I'll get you some water. Hi."
"04","06","19","SUMMER","And a chicken and a snake and a rat"
"04","06","19","SUMMER","It wasn't a mistake. You deliberately used me."
"04","06","19","SUMMER","I hate you. Now leave. This can't be fixed by some candlelight vigil or petition, okay? And I'm not some tree that you can just chain yourself to."
"04","06","19","SUMMER","What? What did you do? This isn't that funny. Give me the key."
"04","06","19","SUMMER","Hmm. Okay, then be prepared to stay here for the rest of your life, 'cause that's never going to happen."
"04","06","20","SANDY","A weekend away at the Montage, honey you've outdone yourself."
"04","06","20","KIRSTEN","I don't know about that."
"04","06","20","SANDY","Oh, no, listen, I'm going to be paying you back later tonight. Guess who packed Scrabble?"
"04","06","20","KIRSTEN","There's just one small wrinkle in this otherwise romantic holiday that I forgot to share."
"04","06","20","SANDY","Not to worry. I TiVoed the Australian Open. Tiger's going to take it any. Just one more thing. Tell me at least he's got a separate room."
"04","06","20","GORDON","Sandy Cohen, you're looking lovely tonight. If my date didn't look so hot, I might scope you out."
"04","06","20","SANDY","I'm jealous. Now, who is the lucky date?"
"04","06","21","KIRSTEN","I'll make this up to you tonight."
"04","06","21","GORDON","I am so damn honored to be here with you and Kirsten for your recommitment ceremony. I am crying already. Come on, let's eat."
"04","06","22","TAYLOR","Wait until you see the Takeshi Kitano in my cat(alog)"
"04","06","22","TAYLOR","It's packed in its original packaging, so no gro...ping Summer. Che."
"04","06","22","SUMMER","Ta. Taylor."
"04","06","22","TAYLOR","Roger, Summer. Che."
"04","06","22","TAYLOR","Summer. Che.What are you doing?"
"04","06","22","SUMMER","Well, I live here again, so I moved some of your stuff to the guest room"
"04","06","22","TAYLOR","ahuh. Are you two handcuffed to each other?"
"04","06","22","TAYLOR","Summer Roberts, you've learned a few things from that college roommate of yours. When'd Seth arrive?"
"04","06","22","SUMMER","Ill, no, it's not like that. In fact, don't talk to him He's not here."
"04","06","22","SUMMER","How about killing you?"
"04","06","22","TAYLOR","Okay, to which guest room did you move my things?"
"04","06","22","SUMMER","I'll show u !"
"04","06","22","TAYLOR","what was that?"
"04","06","22","SUMMER","Get..."
"04","06","23","KAITLIN","That's why you're pushing, not me."
"04","06","23","SUMMER","Kaitlin, what is going on?"
"04","06","23","KAITLIN","Just having a few friends over to my house."
"04","06","23","SUMMER","It's my house."
"04","06","23","TAYLOR","I think you cannot have a party. Your mother left me in charge."
"04","06","23","SUMMER","Actually, she left me in charge."
"04","06","23","KAITLIN","Summer, why is this guy handcuffed to your wrist?"
"04","06","23","SUMMER","No, there's no one handcuffed to my wrist. He doesn't exist."
"04","06","23","KAITLIN","Also kind of feaky. Okay. You guys hurry up. I got to tap these kegs because we're running out of time."
"04","06","23","SUMMER","What?"
"04","06","23","KAITLIN","This way"
"04","06","23","TAYLOR","Kaitlin! Roger?!"
"04","06","24","SETH","You won't believe your eyes. Ride with me, Ryan. So the good news is, my frequent-flier miles just reached platinum. The bad news is, they don't change the in-flight movie, and Failure to Launch does not hold up on the third viewing."
"04","06","24","RYAN","What are you doing here?"
"04","06","24","SETH","Summer got kicked out of school and I'm about to head over there."
"04","06","24","RYAN","Can I come with you?"
"04","06","24","SETH","I appreciate your interest in Summer's future, but I think this is a conversation that's just for the two of us."
"04","06","24","RYAN","Is Taylor going to be there?"
"04","06","24","SETH","I assume so."
"04","06","24","RYAN","I like her."
"04","06","24","SETH","Say what now? Why would you even think that?"
"04","06","24","RYAN","Because I keep imagining her on roller skates and washing windows with a big bucket of soapy water."
"04","06","24","SETH","Dude, your fantasies are so pedestrian. A sudsy girl? That's... so average."
"04","06","24","RYAN","Doesn't mean it's not hot."
"04","06","24","SETH","I guess they call them classics for a reason."
"04","06","24","RYAN","Do you want to drive or sh-should I?"
"04","06","25","TAYLOR","Okay, game night! Who wants to play Pictionary, huh? Come on, guys, get high on life! Hey! Hey! Cut it out! I tan on this chair."
"04","06","25","SUMMER","Out of my way, wasteoid."
"04","06","25","SUMMER","Che, shut up!"
"04","06","25","TAYLOR","Where's Kaitlin?"
"04","06","25","KAITLIN","You guys, your seven minutes is up. And I'm next. It's Connor."
"04","06","25","KAITLIN","'Cause I don't really like school."
"04","06","25","KAITLIN","So are we going to make out or what? 'Cause the clock is kind of ticking."
"04","06","25","KAITLIN","I'm not. Let's make out. Are you afraid to cheat on Riley?"
"04","06","25","KAITLIN","So what's the problem? Are you... gay?"
"04","06","25","KAITLIN","Sweetheart, you're so gay."
"04","06","26","GORDON","I know the Jews are good with numbers and lending stuff."
"04","06","26","SANDY","Now, there's a generalization that's not even remotely offensive."
"04","06","26","GORDON","Well, hold on there, He-bro. It's just, if you all control the media, why does everyone know? Why not use the media to say someone else controls it? It would cause a lot less resentment that way."
"04","06","26","KIRSTEN","You know, we should talk about something else. Dinner was delicious."
"04","06","26","GORDON","Like you ate! Oh, I know what they say ""Eat light on Saturday night."" Less food in the stomach for the booze."
"04","06","26","JULIE","Bullet, Kirsten doesn't drink."
"04","06","26","KIRSTEN","Time for bed. I have a headache."
"04","06","26","GORDON","Uh-oh! I guess she doesn't do that either."
"04","06","26","SANDY","Thank you, Gordon. Your point of view regarding the Middle East is something I will treasure forever."
"04","06","26","GORDON","It was Iran-Iraq war. Whoever loses, we win."
"04","06","26","SANDY","Honey, let's see if we can cancel our room."
"04","06","26","KIRSTEN","Sounds like a plan. Good night, Julie."
"04","06","26","JULIE","Good night."
"04","06","26","SANDY","Good night."
"04","06","26","GORDON","What about their wedding vows?"
"04","06","26","JULIE","That was a lie, Bullet. Told to avoid you, because you are an ignorant buffoon. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to try and salvage my friendship with Sandy and Kirsten."
"04","06","26","GORDON","You want some more coffee?"
"04","06","27","RYAN","Let's split up."
"04","06","27","SETH","All right, good luck."
"04","06","27","RYAN","You, too. Taylor? Taylor?"
"04","06","27","TAYLOR","Ryan?"
"04","06","27","RYAN","Roger, hey. Uh, keep doing what you're doing. I was looking for Taylor, but clearly she's..."
"04","06","27","RYAN","Uh, Taylor isn't in there with you guys, is she?"
"04","06","27","RYAN","Okay. What are you doing, man? Um, I mean, I think Taylor really likes you, and you're kindof leading her on."
"04","06","27","RYAN","Wait, she paid you to pretend to like her? That sounds like Taylor. All right, well, uh... carry on."
"04","06","28","SETH","What are you doing here, Sandals? Ruining Summer's life at Brown wasn't enough?"
"04","06","28","SUMMER","Cohen, you're here!"
"04","06","28","SETH","Yeah. Now I want to see what this guy's got to say for himself."
"04","06","28","SUMMER","Please, Seth."
"04","06","28","SETH","Huh?"
"04","06","28","SETH","...to the pool."
"04","06","28","SUMMER","What? What? No! Cohen!"
"04","06","29","KAITLIN","So you dress like a ho for no reason?"
"04","06","29","KAITLIN","Oh."
"04","06","29","KAITLIN","Except that I don't want it. Just be nicer to your friends."
"04","06","29","KAITLIN","Connor's totally gay. Hi, 911? Yeah, I'd like to report a totally lame partyer."
"04","06","30","SETH","Sorry, I didn't realize about the hand cuffs."
"04","06","30","SUMMER","Well, you know, it's all Che's fault."
"04","06","30","SUMMER","I'm capable of a lot of hate."
"04","06","30","SETH","It's true."
"04","06","30","SUMMER","We did a lot of good."
"04","06","30","SUMMER","I liberated those bunnies because I believed that they should be set free. I knew the consequences if I got caught. Look, I can't spend my whole life blaming you, so I accept your apology."
"04","06","30","SETH","With an asterisk next to it. And there's a footnote at the bottom. And it says you don't deserve it."
"04","06","30","SUMMER","No, you... Could you unlock us first?"
"04","06","30","SETH","Yours leads toward the airport."
"04","06","30","SUMMER","Winchester? Winchester?"
"04","06","30","SUMMER","I thought you grew up on a reservation."
"04","06","30","SUMMER","Well, I guess every kid finds a way to rebel against their parents."
"04","06","30","SETH","So he was a liar, a coward and a hypocrite. At least he had depth."
"04","06","30","SUMMER","I guess I am really back home again."
"04","06","30","SETH","Which is great, except now I have to leave."
"04","06","31","RYAN","Taylor?"
"04","06","31","TAYLOR","Ryan."
"04","06","31","RYAN","What are you doing?"
"04","06","31","TAYLOR","Someone wrote I love poop on this poor boy's face. You know, that kind of thing can scar you for life."
"04","06","31","RYAN","No, what are you doing paying your gay friend Roger to pretend he's in love with you?"
"04","06","31","TAYLOR","Well, what if I did, hmm? What if I did rent a homosexual for the evening? And pay him with rare collectibles from Asian cinema? What difference does it make to you?"
"04","06","31","RYAN","Well, it's a little strange."
"04","06","31","TAYLOR","Well, so am I. Which is why you ran away from me last night."
"04","06","31","RYAN","No, it wasn't 'cause you're strange."
"04","06","31","TAYLOR","You don't find me strange?"
"04","06","31","RYAN","No, I do, but that's not why I took off. Look, I'm not really ready for a relationship right now or a girlfriend."
"04","06","31","TAYLOR","Uh... girlfriend? Cart, horse? Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself there? Well, I mean, just because I want to use your body as a jungle gym, doesn't mean that we have to get married."
"04","06","31","RYAN","I see."
"04","06","31","TAYLOR","I mean, my divorce papers aren't even dry yet. Look, you're a sweet, smart, great guy, Ryan Atwood. And hot. Did I mention hot? So whatever happens, happens."
"04","06","31","RYAN","Taylor, that's..."
"04","06","31","TAYLOR","Normal?"
"04","06","31","RYAN","Yeah."
"04","06","31","TAYLOR","Yeah, I have my moments. You know, this is my first high school bash. Have you ever played Seven Minutes in Heaven?"
"04","06","32","JULIE","Thanks to you, Sandy and Kirsten are packed and on the road."
"04","06","32","GORDON","I'm sorry, Julie. When God was handing out brains, I guess I was sitting on the toilet. I swear you make me all nervous inside."
"04","06","32","JULIE","So you only act like a bigot and a sexist pig around me?"
"04","06","32","GORDON","No, I just feel worse about it when you're around. You're such a classy and elegant dame."
"04","06","32","JULIE","Well, that is true."
"04","06","32","GORDON","Look, I was trying so hard to make you laugh, and I know what a hard time you've been through, and I... it just came out all wrong."
"04","06","32","JULIE","I appreciate that, Gordon."
"04","06","32","GORDON","I guess you're heading on home now, too, huh?"
"04","06","32","JULIE","Are you kidding? I put the room on the company card. I've got a mud bath in the morning."
"04","06","32","GORDON","So, since I ruined dinner, how about breakfast?"
"04","06","32","JULIE","Breakfast? Okay."
"04","06","32","GORDON","So, uh, should I call you or nudge you? Bang. That was funny. You have a pretty smile. My job is to get you to use it more."
"04","06","32","JULIE","Then you're going to need better material."
"04","06","32","GORDON","Well, I am working on it. 'Night, Julie."
"04","06","33","SANDY","Can't we be left alone?"
"04","06","33","KIRSTEN","It's probably Julie. She felt terrible."
"04","06","33","SANDY","Well, I bet she did. She spent the night with the Bullet."
"04","06","33","KIRSTEN","Oh, I'm sorry, that was an excuse."
"04","06","33","SANDY","Yeah, we didn't call for anyone."
"04","06","34","JULIE","Hello."
"04","06","34","JULIE","I would assume so, it's pretty late."
"04","06","34","JULIE","My cut? Spencer, you pay to join the service. Your date doesn't pay you. That... that's illegal. You're not a gigolo."
"04","06","34","JULIE","Spencer, wait... Spencer?"
"04","06","34","JULIE","Pam ! So you had a good night?"
"04","06","34","JULIE","And what will you be telling them exactly?"
"04","06","35","TAYLOR","Okay, seven minutes are up. You said you wanted to take it slow."
"04","06","35","RYAN","Yeah, well, I don't think eight minutes would be rushing. Nine seems like a good pace. And ten is a nice, round number."
"04","06","36","SETH","Just let try long-distance thing again. I've got a lotof frequent-flier miles, and we survived one semester apart."
"04","06","36","SUMMER","Yeah, barely."
"04","06","36","SETH","Why don't you move to Providence with me and get a job."
"04","06","36","SUMMER","Oh, right. You'll be in school and I'll be slinging baba ganoush on Third Street, while all the kids are living the life that I should be having."
"04","06","36","SETH","Well, you know, I've really been enjoying home lately. Ryan's back and I've been bonding with the Newpsies. Maybe, uh, I could put off RISD for a semester. We could both go back together in the fall."
"04","06","36","SUMMER","You'd really put off college for me?"
"04","06","36","SETH","Rhode Island is a big place. Better we tackle it together."
"04","06","36","SUMMER","Cohen, Rhode Island's the smallest state in the country."
"04","06","36","SETH","I was kidding."
"04","06","36","SUMMER","Right. There's just one more thing. This is Pancakes. Pancakes is very important to me."
"04","06","36","SETH","Then you can hold it. I'm not really an animal person."
"04","06","36","SUMMER","Cohen, Pancakes is my daughter, or my son, I'm not really sure."
"04","06","36","SETH","Oh... Oh, he's your son."
"04","06","36","SUMMER","He kind of looks like you, Cohen. Feel how soft he is."
"04","06","36","SETH","Yeah. He's beautiful."
"04","06","36","SUMMER","Take a look around, Pancakes. This is your new home."
"04","06","36","SETH","What's the life span of one of these things?"
"04","06","36","SUMMER","Hey !"
"04","06","36","SETH","I'm just curious.I'm asking."
"04","06","36","SUMMER","Infinity."
"04","07","0","KIRSTEN","Oh, hey, I thought you were hanging Christmas lights."
"04","07","0","RYAN","Oh, I took a coffee break, union rules."
"04","07","0","KIRSTEN","Well, you better hurry up, it's going to startraining any minute, and you know how Seth loves his rooftop reindeer."
"04","07","0","RYAN","Yeah, don't worry, it'll be up by dinner."
"04","07","0","KIRSTEN","Oh, speaking of dinner, are you going to bring a guest?"
"04","07","0","RYAN","That's pretty subtle, Kirsten."
"04","07","0","KIRSTEN","I'm not saying you'd bring Taylor, I'm just letting you know that she's welcome."
"04","07","0","RYAN","Uh-huh. Well, I don't know. I don't know, it's, uh, it's just..."
"04","07","0","KIRSTEN","Oh, you think that if you invite her, she's your girlfriend. Boy, so predictable."
"04","07","0","RYAN","Hey, now, inviting a girl over for Christmas Eve, that's like making some sort of announcement."
"04","07","0","KIRSTEN","It's Chrismukkah. We make our own rules."
"04","07","0","RYAN","Fine. Set a place for her. I'll invite her today."
"04","07","0","KIRSTEN","Great."
"04","07","0","KIRSTEN","Okay. Oh, my ham guy."
"04","07","1","KAITLIN","Can't believe we're spending Christmas in the ghetto."
"04","07","1","JULIE","It's not the ghetto. It's Riverside, and it's where our family is from."
"04","07","1","KAITLIN","I thought we were in denial about that."
"04","07","1","JULIE","Kaitlin, in case you hadn't noticed, we're a little short on family these days. I think we should take all we can get."
"04","07","1","TAYLOR","Happy holidays."
"04","07","1","JULIE","Hello."
"04","07","1","KAITLIN","Is that a gift for me? 'Cause I forgot to get you one."
"04","07","1","TAYLOR","No, this is for Ryan. I got him a George Foreman grill because he likes lean meat, obviously."
"04","07","1","JULIE","Lovely. So, Taylor, uh, Summer's having dinner with the Cohens, but you're welcome to come with us to Riverside, unless of course you're doing something with your mother."
"04","07","1","TAYLOR","Oh, no, no. She sent me a mass E-mail last week. She's spending Christmas in Cabo. She would've invited me, but she knows that I don't like Mexican food. But it's not a problem because I'm having dinner over at Ryan's."
"04","07","1","JULIE","Oh, I didn't know you were invited over there."
"04","07","1","TAYLOR","I'm not... well, yet. But I'm sure he's going to ask me. Well, I mean, I hope he does. Well, he will. So I better go over there and give him his gift."
"04","07","1","KAITLIN","Last chance to come to Riverside. You want to watch my Aunt Cindy do whippets underneath the mistletoe?"
"04","07","1","TAYLOR","Uh... no, thanks. But you guys have a good time. Bye."
"04","07","2","TAYLOR","I know, where's the mistletoe, right? But don't worry, we can kiss anyway."
"04","07","2","RYAN","Uh, Taylor, I'm a little busy right now."
"04","07","2","TAYLOR","Well, don't you want your present?"
"04","07","2","RYAN","Just leave it right there. I'll open it later."
"04","07","2","TAYLOR","You know I just ran into Kirsten in the kitchen, and she was talking to some guy with a huge ham. Are you guys having dinner or something?"
"04","07","2","RYAN","Uh, yeah."
"04","07","2","TAYLOR","Poor Ryan. All of his muscles are so developed, except for the ones in his mouth. You want to invite me to Chrismukkah, but you don't know how, so I will save you the trouble. I would love to come."
"04","07","2","RYAN","Taylor, look, I don't know what's going on between us, but it's only been a few weeks."
"04","07","2","TAYLOR","And you think if you invite me to Chrismukkah, then that makes me your girlfriend."
"04","07","2","RYAN","I don't want to hurt your feelings, but yeah."
"04","07","2","TAYLOR","Hurt my feelings? Why would that hurt my feelings? Just because I spent time and money getting you the perfect gift-- which, by the way, happens to be the deluxe version of the George Foreman grill-- and in return you give me a hot, steaming pile of rejection. Well, you know, I think that's just fine. Because I'm used to it, okay? So here, here it is. Grill away."
"04","07","2","RYAN","Taylor, I don't want this."
"04","07","2","TAYLOR","No, I took your gift-- the holiday-themed rejection-- so you should take it."
"04","07","2","RYAN","No, you take it."
"04","07","2","TAYLOR","I bought it for you. You take it. It's yours. I..."
"04","07","2","RYAN","Taylor!"
"04","07","3","KIRSTEN","Are you sure this is a Virginia ham?"
"04","07","4","RYAN","Taylor? Taylor, are you... are you hurt?"
"04","07","4","TAYLOR","Only my heart, Ryan. Only my heart."
"04","07","4","RYAN","Come on up, I'll get you some ice."
"04","07","4","TAYLOR","Oh, you're offering me ice? Hmm, I guess I should jump at that. Here. The receipt's inside. I hope you grill your face."
"04","07","5","RYAN","Oh, so, I was just in the pool house..."
"04","07","5","KIRSTEN","What are you doing in there? I told the supervisor that this is off-limits to the staff."
"04","07","5","RYAN","What?"
"04","07","5","KIRSTEN","Where is your supervisor?"
"04","07","5","RYAN","Uh, Kirsten, what are you talking about?"
"04","07","5","KIRSTEN","Excuse me, do I know you?"
"04","07","6","KIRSTEN","I said do I know you?"
"04","07","6","RYAN","Uh, look, I don't know what's going on, but... I was up on the roof with Taylor..."
"04","07","6","KIRSTEN","Is this one of your guys?"
"04","07","6","KIRSTEN","Oh, great.So now I just have strangers wandering around my house."
"04","07","6","RYAN","No, no, no. Where's Seth?"
"04","07","7","JULIE","You see, this is why I feel so strongly about this issue. Take Daryl here. Last week he was homeless. But because of the money we've raised, he has a future to look forward toin the new year."
"04","07","7","JULIE","Yes. And I help people."
"04","07","7","RYAN","Julie."
"04","07","7","JULIE","I love it when they call me by my first name."
"04","07","7","RYAN","What are you doing? What is all this?"
"04","07","7","JULIE","Take this, it's a voucher for the mission. Tell them I sent you."
"04","07","7","RYAN","You don't know me?"
"04","07","7","JULIE","I know your pain. See, people think that Newport Beach is a cold city, a place of privilege. But even this poor street urchin has found hope here. Now you just run along now, honey."
"04","07","8","SETH","You guys, come on."
"04","07","8","SETH","Would you... would you give me back..."
"04","07","8","SETH","Would you... would you give me back my wallet? Seriously."
"04","07","8","RYAN","Hey, hey, give me that."
"04","07","8","SETH","I make love to ladies. Hey, man, thanks. Do I know you from Brown?"
"04","07","8","RYAN","You go to Brown?"
"04","07","8","SETH","Yeah. Who are you?"
"04","07","8","RYAN","You don't know me either? I can't believe this."
"04","07","8","SETH","Which one?"
"04","07","8","RYAN","Wait, Sandy Cohen? You know where he is?"
"04","07","8","RYAN","Press conference?"
"04","07","8","SETH","Oh, just... just look at her. Oh, I shouldn't be watching."
"04","07","8","RYAN","Why, bad luck to see the bride?"
"04","07","8","SETH","Yeah, totally. Oh, God."
"04","07","8","RYAN","You okay? Oh!"
"04","07","9","SANDY","This holiday, I think my wife and I are just going to take it easy."
"04","07","9","SANDY","True, she's a very busy lady. All right, Joe, thanks very much."
"04","07","9","SANDY","And thanks for all your support. As I always say, I am mayor of the greatest city on earth. Vote Sandy Cohen!"
"04","07","9","RYAN","You're the mayor?"
"04","07","9","SANDY","Why, you want to call for a recount? Happy holidays."
"04","07","9","RYAN","Uh, Sandy, Sandy. Something terrible is happening. And if anyone can make it make sense, it's you."
"04","07","9","SANDY","Uh, no. It's fine. All right, kid, slow down, tell me what the problem is."
"04","07","9","RYAN","Okay. So, uh, I fell off the roof this morning, and ever since then nobody recognizes me. Even Kirsten threw me out of the house."
"04","07","9","SANDY","You saw Kirsten?"
"04","07","9","RYAN","And Seth doesn't know who I am either. And he's marrying Summer?"
"04","07","9","SANDY","I see that you're having some trouble and I sympathize with that. But stalking me and my family is not the answer."
"04","07","9","SANDY","Oh, the poor kid."
"04","07","11","SANDY","Kirsten. What happened?"
"04","07","11","KIRSTEN","Taylor and Ryan, they were hanging decorations, and I guess the ladder fell."
"04","07","11","SANDY","What did the doctors say?"
"04","07","11","KIRSTEN","Well, they said apparently there's no serious injury, we just have to wait for them to wake up."
"04","07","12","TAYLOR","Ryan? Is that you?"
"04","07","12","RYAN","Taylor. You know me?"
"04","07","12","TAYLOR","Oh, my God. I found you."
"04","07","13","RYAN","We're in a parallel universe."
"04","07","13","TAYLOR","Exactly. Okay. And I'm so grateful that if I have to be in a parallel universe, that you're here with me. Oh, that's... Of course you probably wish you were with someone you actually wanted to date. That would be nice, wouldn't it?"
"04","07","13","RYAN","Oh, even in a parallel universe, she never stops. But I mean, we could also be asleep, right? Or dead?"
"04","07","13","TAYLOR","Ow. You're awake. As for being dead, I'm guessing if we were, there would be some kind of white light situation, maybe a guy with a beard. Process of elimination, parallel universe."
"04","07","13","RYAN","How do you know all this?"
"04","07","13","TAYLOR","Oh, tenth grade I had a little sci-fi phase. Alt-universes are huge. Clearly, you and I have entered a world where we don't exist. But don't despair. I know the way back to the real world."
"04","07","13","RYAN","Yeah? Does it involve me dating you?"
"04","07","13","TAYLOR","Well, well, look who's funny in alt-world."
"04","07","13","RYAN","I know."
"04","07","13","TAYLOR","No, Ryan, we have been sent here to fix something. It's the only explanation. Someone or some ones we know are in trouble."
"04","07","13","SUMMER","Hi!"
"04","07","13","RYAN","Oh, my God."
"04","07","13","SUMMER","What, you mean this old thing?"
"04","07","13","SUMMER","Four carats."
"04","07","13","SUMMER","Can I get a...?"
"04","07","13","TAYLOR","Alt-Summer is a mindless bimbo."
"04","07","13","SUMMER","Get it started, Newport! Whoo! I'm so excited."
"04","07","13","SUMMER","Oh, you know him, he's parking. He won't let any of the valets touch his Hummer."
"04","07","13","SUMMER","Because that's my job, bitch."
"04","07","13","SUMMER","Mm-hmm, that's me."
"04","07","13","TAYLOR","Okay, wait a second. I thought you said she was marrying Seth. That's Che, or Chester, I guess, in alt-reality."
"04","07","13","RYAN","What's he doing here? I thought he goes to Brown."
"04","07","13","TAYLOR","Okay, what if three years ago his family had planned to move here but you did instead, taking the last spot at Harbor? So without quality education for their child, his family moves to Connecticut. But in a world where you don't exist, the Harbor spot was open, so his family moves here, thereby allowing Che to fulfill his alt-destiny as a Newport bobble head. Well, obviously this is what we've been sent here to fix."
"04","07","13","SUMMER","Ooh... baby. Do you mind?"
"04","07","13","SUMMER","But that's my job, bitch. Oh, yeah, give it up. Whoo! Ooh... Hey, bitch!"
"04","07","13","TAYLOR","Okay, we need to get started right away. You go to Seth, find out where it all went wrong I will follow Summer and do some recon."
"04","07","13","RYAN","Uh, where do we meet?"
"04","07","13","TAYLOR","It's alt-universe. We'll just find each other."
"04","07","14","SANDY","Is there anything we can do to help?"
"04","07","14","KIRSTEN","Okay, thank you."
"04","07","14","SANDY","Thank you."
"04","07","14","SUMMER","Well, somebody should find Taylor's mom. I guess I'll do that."
"04","07","14","SETH","Ew, signing up for the suicide mission."
"04","07","14","KIRSTEN","Oh, my ham. I have to go home and turn off the oven."
"04","07","14","SANDY","Seth and I will take care of the ham. In fact, she just said we should surround them with familiar sounds and smells. So I say we bring Chrismukkah to the hospital."
"04","07","14","KIRSTEN","That's a great idea. And I'll look after Taylor and Ryan. And you be careful with my ham."
"04","07","14","SANDY","I'll be very careful."
"04","07","15","SUMMER","Okay."
"04","07","15","SUMMER","Bye, baby."
"04","07","16","RYAN","Hello? Hello?"
"04","07","16","KIRSTEN","Oh, it's you again. Looking for Seth?"
"04","07","16","RYAN","Uh, yeah, they told me at the comic book store he came home."
"04","07","16","KIRSTEN","Well, I haven't seen him yet. You might want to try him upstairs. Honey? Could you bring me my glass?"
"04","07","16","KIRSTEN","Oh, thank you."
"04","07","16","RYAN","Jimmy?"
"04","07","16","KIRSTEN","You know my husband?"
"04","07","16","JIMMY","I don't believe we've actually met."
"04","07","16","KIRSTEN","Oh, this is a friend of Seth's."
"04","07","16","JIMMY","Oh."
"04","07","16","KIRSTEN","I know, it must be a Christmas miracle."
"04","07","16","JIMMY","Well, you should come to the party tonight. All of Newport's going to be there."
"04","07","16","KIRSTEN","Well, they better be, if they want to keep doing business with the Newport Group. Seth!"
"04","07","16","JIMMY","He's not home. He's probably out stalking Summer Roberts."
"04","07","16","RYAN","I'm going to go."
"04","07","17","SANDY","Oh, and ""philanthropist"" means you help people."
"04","07","17","JULIE","Oh, well, you learn something every day. Listen, are you coming home before the party? You know how you sweat through your shirts."
"04","07","17","SANDY","Can't we make some excuse?"
"04","07","17","JULIE","Listen, honey, as long as you're mayor and she is head of the Newport Group, you're gonna have to deal with each other. Honestly, I don't know how you were ever married to that ice queen."
"04","07","17","SANDY","Well, we were different people back then. I'll be home in a couple hours."
"04","07","17","JULIE","Bye."
"04","07","18","TAYLOR","Joinx! Double-O joinx."
"04","07","18","TAYLOR","Mima? Hi. No? Yes, you don't know me. Uh, I was just..."
"04","07","18","TAYLOR","Yes, yes, that's exactly what..."
"04","07","18","TAYLOR","Triple-O joinx."
"04","07","19","TAYLOR","Oh, my God. Oh, my God, move over."
"04","07","19","RYAN","Taylor, why don't you just sit over...?"
"04","07","19","TAYLOR","Ryan, don't worry. It doesn't mean we're boyfriend and girlfriend. I have huge news."
"04","07","19","RYAN","Yeah, well, me, too. Sandy and Kirsten are divorced and she and Jimmy are married."
"04","07","19","TAYLOR","Ew, yikes, that is huge. I can beat it, though. Sandy Cohen is married to Julie."
"04","07","19","RYAN","What?"
"04","07","19","TAYLOR","And she's having an affair with Che."
"04","07","19","TAYLOR","Ryan, there's something else."
"04","07","19","RYAN","Yeah, what else?"
"04","07","19","RYAN","Uh, Taylor, can you let me out?"
"04","07","19","TAYLOR","Why? Do you have to go to the bathroom? I haven't had to go. It seems like it's not an issue in an alt-world."
"04","07","19","RYAN","Taylor, seriously, let me out."
"04","07","19","TAYLOR","Are you going to the airport? Ryan, she won't even know you."
"04","07","19","RYAN","It doesn't matter."
"04","07","19","TAYLOR","Even if Marissa is fine in this world, which, thank God she is, we need to focus on fixing what is broken. Because that's what's going to get us back to the real world."
"04","07","19","RYAN","But if she's alive..."
"04","07","19","TAYLOR","Then you don't want to go back? Okay. I get it. You... you got to go."
"04","07","19","RYAN","Sorry."
"04","07","20","JULIE","I can't believe we have to drive to Riverside in this. Oh, no, honey, I told you. My family only drinks wine coolers."
"04","07","20","KAITLIN","We're having a very Britney Christmas, Mother."
"04","07","20","JULIE","Yes, watch out. I might put you on my lap while we drive out there."
"04","07","20","SUMMER","Oh, thank God you're still here. Ryan and Taylor are in a coma but we're not supposed to worry."
"04","07","20","JULIE","What are you talking about?"
"04","07","20","SUMMER","They fell off a ladder. But the doctor says they're fine. We just have to wait for them to wake up."
"04","07","20","KAITLIN","So it's a coma light?"
"04","07","20","SUMMER","Exactly. I have to find Veronica Townsend. Do you know where she is?"
"04","07","20","JULIE","Taylor said she's flying to Cabo tonight. But she may have already left."
"04","07","20","KAITLIN","I really don't think that Veronica is going to care if Taylor's in a bogus coma."
"04","07","20","JULIE","Well, it doesn't matter. Her daughter's in the hospital. She needs to know. Come on, I'll drive."
"04","07","20","SUMMER","You don't have to."
"04","07","20","JULIE","Taylor is my responsibility. She's living in my house. Come on."
"04","07","20","KAITLIN","So no Riverside? Sweet. I mean, I hate comas. Let's go find Veronica."
"04","07","21","KIRSTEN","Oh, thank you. I've been talking to them and reading to them out loud. I know the doctor says not to worry..."
"04","07","21","KIRSTEN","Thanks."
"04","07","22","RYAN","Marissa?"
"04","07","22","KAITLIN","Who are you?"
"04","07","22","RYAN","Uh, I'm sorry. I thought, uh..."
"04","07","22","KAITLIN","What, you knew my sister?"
"04","07","22","RYAN","I thought she was cominghome from Berkeley."
"04","07","22","KAITLIN","No, that's me. The youngest in my freshman class. Sort of a prodigy."
"04","07","22","RYAN","Uh, what... what did you mean ""knew""?"
"04","07","22","KAITLIN","She died three years ago."
"04","07","22","RYAN","What?"
"04","07","22","KAITLIN","She OD'd in an alleyway in Tijuana. Well, that's really the way I want to start my Christmas vacation. Wait, who are you again?"
"04","07","22","RYAN","No one."
"04","07","22","KAITLIN","Oh, okay. Well, Merry Christmas."
"04","07","23","TAYLOR","I'm sorry. Ryan, you gave her three more years. She got to fall in love. She got to graduate."
"04","07","23","RYAN","And then she still died."
"04","07","23","TAYLOR","Which just means that you weren't meant to save her. So if there's any part of you that's still blaming yourself for what happened, you have to let it go. You've done so much for everybody."
"04","07","24","TAYLOR","Ryan, haven't you been paying attention? You saved the Cohens. Without you, Seth is the next unibomber, Sandy is married to Slutty McSlutterman, and Kirsten probably hasn't had an orgasm in, like, a year."
"04","07","24","RYAN","Uh, all right, all right."
"04","07","24","TAYLOR","And if you think that I'm just gonna let you give up, you're crazy."
"04","07","24","RYAN","Taylor, I said all right."
"04","07","24","TAYLOR","Oh. Oh, good. Okay."
"04","07","24","RYAN","Has anyone ever said ""no"" to you?"
"04","07","24","TAYLOR","Once. And I pushed him off the roof. Kidding. Let's save the Cohens and go home."
"04","07","24","RYAN","All right."
"04","07","24","TAYLOR","Okay."
"04","07","25","SANDY","An alternate universe?"
"04","07","25","SETH","It's the only obvious explanation."
"04","07","25","SANDY","""Obvious"" might not be the word I would use."
"04","07","25","SETH","They both got knocked out at the same time and neither is waking up."
"04","07","25","SANDY","Like Dorothy in Oz."
"04","07","25","SETH","And just like Dorothy had to go see the wizard, they've got some mission to accomplish before they can return."
"04","07","25","SANDY","Like what?"
"04","07","25","SETH","Uh, anything. Could be like our world, only messed up. They've got to reset the balance. Or could be a world ruled by giant vegetables, and they've got to topple the vegetable despot before they can come back."
"04","07","25","SANDY","You had me till vegetable despot."
"04","07","25","SETH","It makes perfect sense."
"04","07","26","SANDY","Hello."
"04","07","26","KIRSTEN","Sandy, I think I know why Ryan hasn't woken up."
"04","07","27","TAYLOR","Hi. Okay, now before we can reunite everyone with their rightful partners, we need to prep them first. So I will take Kirsten duty and you can..."
"04","07","27","SETH","I already told you, I'm not going to your stupid party."
"04","07","27","KIRSTEN","Because Summer Roberts is going to be here? Since when are you avoiding her?"
"04","07","27","SETH","Since she got engaged to that burly ding-dong. You have fun."
"04","07","27","RYAN","I'm on it."
"04","07","28","TAYLOR","Oh, my God. In alt-world, I'm a boy. Maybe I should try Pilates. They say it elongates you. Outside."
"04","07","28","TAYLOR","And my mom is still a bitch."
"04","07","29","JULIE","Veronica. Veronica. Thank God, we caught you."
"04","07","29","JULIE","Veronica, you can't go to Mexico. Taylor is in the hospital."
"04","07","29","JULIE","No, she fell off a ladder."
"04","07","29","JULIE","The doctor says she'll be fine, but she's not waking up. Maybe if she heard your voice. Summer has a car outside..."
"04","07","29","JULIE","Veronica, listen. I know you're not the warm and fuzzy type. But it is Christmas Eve and it would mean so much if you could be there. And if you get on that plane right now, I'll tell security you have a bomb."
"04","07","29","KAITLIN","Wow, very Jack Bauer of you."
"04","07","30","RYAN","All right. All right, come on,put this on."
"04","07","30","SETH","No, hate my life! I hate my life...! I hate my life!"
"04","07","30","RYAN","Yeah, no wonder Summer doesn't like you."
"04","07","30","SETH","See?! Even you think so. And no offense, but it's kind of weird, you having such a vested interest in my love life, considering I just met you this morning."
"04","07","30","RYAN","All right. You want the truth?"
"04","07","30","SETH","I know the truth."
"04","07","30","RYAN","You know the truth?"
"04","07","30","SETH","Yeah."
"04","07","30","RYAN","I'm from an alternate universe where your dad adopted me and you and Summer are in love. And unless I fix things here, which means getting your parents and you and Summer together, I can't go home."
"04","07","30","SETH","I always knew this would happen."
"04","07","30","RYAN","Doesn't surprise me. Put this on. Okay. Now, I'm going to tell you exactly what you need to know to woo Summer. Have you ever heard of a show called The Valley?"
"04","07","31","TAYLOR","Hey. It's a great party, huh?"
"04","07","31","KIRSTEN","Yes."
"04","07","31","TAYLOR","I'm so glad that the mayor let me off so that I could come."
"04","07","31","KIRSTEN","You work for the mayor?"
"04","07","31","TAYLOR","Mm-hmm."
"04","07","31","KIRSTEN","How... well, what's that like?"
"04","07","31","TAYLOR","Honestly, it's amazing that anything ever gets done. What with the mayor moping and crying all day about how he's still in love with his ex-wife. But I probably shouldn't be airing his dirty laundry. I mean, she must be around here somewhere, right? Well, I better mingle."
"04","07","32","TAYLOR","Good, you got a jacket from Seth."
"04","07","32","RYAN","Yeah."
"04","07","33","RYAN","Great. He's going over stalking points right now."
"04","07","33","TAYLOR","Well, I am doing some serious Jedi mind tricks on Kirsten."
"04","07","33","RYAN","There's couple number two."
"04","07","33","SUMMER","That's my man."
"04","07","33","TAYLOR","Okay, so what we need to do is get Kirsten and Sandy and Seth and Summer alone together for ten minutes. Which means removing the obstacles. You take Julie, I've got Chester. Hey, wouldn't this actually be fun, you know, if you were actually doing it with somebody who you wanted to date?"
"04","07","33","RYAN","Go."
"04","07","33","TAYLOR","Okay, I'll stop."
"04","07","34","TAYLOR","Hi."
"04","07","34","TAYLOR","Yeah. So, listen, a red-haired lady wanted me to give you a message. She's in the master bathroom and she needs help with something."
"04","07","34","TAYLOR","Charming. Well, uh, she's waiting."
"04","07","34","SUMMER","Wow, really tempting. Um, I'm going to pass."
"04","07","35","SANDY","Good to see you again. Thanks for coming."
"04","07","35","RYAN","Hi."
"04","07","35","JULIE","Hello."
"04","07","35","RYAN","Hi."
"04","07","35","JULIE","Do I know you?"
"04","07","35","RYAN","There's some guy who wants to meet you in the master bathroom. Something about getting a thong on?"
"04","07","35","JULIE","Oh. That's charity talk. ""Thong"" is an acronym for The Homeless of Newport... Go... or something. Excuse me."
"04","07","36","SANDY","Just do me a favor, and don't get caught."
"04","07","36","TAYLOR","Mr. Mayor."
"04","07","36","SANDY","Yes?"
"04","07","36","TAYLOR","Hi, I was wondering, do you have time for a quick question?"
"04","07","36","SANDY","I'm hoping it's about the new hospital. Because Dr. Henry Griffin and I have some big plans."
"04","07","36","TAYLOR","Actually, it's about relationships. You see, you and I are kind of in the same position, because I just broke up with this guy, and he refuses to move on."
"04","07","36","SANDY","I'm not sure how this applies to me."
"04","07","36","TAYLOR","Mr. Mayor, come on. I mean, your ex-wife will tell anyone who listens about how much she's still in love with you. I work at the Newport Group. And it is amazing that anything ever gets done."
"04","07","36","SANDY","Young lady, I don't know you. But I do know that this is not an appropriate conversation. So please excuse me."
"04","07","36","TAYLOR","Uh, mail truck."
"04","07","36","TAYLOR","What? Uh, yeah, um... from the old days at Berkeley, when you guys first fell in love. She won't shut up about it. Mail truck, mail truck, mail truck. It's just crazy, huh?Bye."
"04","07","37","SUMMER","So, wait, you're saying that you ride horses in the valley?"
"04","07","37","SETH","No, no, I like plastic horses and the show The Valley."
"04","07","37","SUMMER","Hey, I like that show, too, and plastic horses. What's yours' name?"
"04","07","37","SETH","Uh, Princess Sparkle. Wait, no, no, I mean Captain Oats. I just said ""Princess Sparkle, 'cause I think that's a really cool name."
"04","07","37","SUMMER","No way! You are not going to believe this."
"04","07","38","RYAN","How's it going?"
"04","07","38","TAYLOR","Well, I read lips, and in the past two minutes, the words ""mail truck"" have come up nine times."
"04","07","38","RYAN","We might actually pull this off."
"04","07","38","TAYLOR","But, Mom?"
"04","07","38","TAYLOR","No."
"04","07","39","TAYLOR","You know what? I think it's time I talk to her as an adult. Okay, you can do this."
"04","07","39","TAYLOR","Shut up. Why do you have to be so mean? Neither he nor I are remotely fat. We are smart and attractive, and interesting and people like us. And we are not going to let you make us feel bad about ourselves anymore."
"04","07","39","TAYLOR","You bitch! Oh, my God."
"04","07","40","RYAN","You all right?"
"04","07","40","TAYLOR","I just can't believe I just said that. I mean, I've been waiting for so long. I can't believe I finally did it."
"04","07","40","RYAN","I'm proud of you."
"04","07","40","TAYLOR","Thanks, Ryan, I... Whoa."
"04","07","40","RYAN","What is it? What's wrong?"
"04","07","40","TAYLOR","I don't know, I ju... Do you hear something? Almost like rain?"
"04","07","40","RYAN","Stay here, I'll get you a glass of water."
"04","07","40","TAYLOR","Okay."
"04","07","41","JIMMY","In my own house? In my own bathroom? I have to brush my teeth in there."
"04","07","41","JIMMY","Oh, Julie, you haven't changed a bit."
"04","07","41","JULIE","Maybe you should learn to knock."
"04","07","42","SANDY","What's going on in here?"
"04","07","42","JIMMY","Well, Mr. Mayor, let me just tell you what I found your wife doing."
"04","07","42","JULIE","Jimmy, don't."
"04","07","42","JIMMY","Well, suffice to say, her thong was in his mouth."
"04","07","42","SUMMER","Shut up!"
"04","07","42","SUMMER","Oh, but that's what you said with Holly. How come all these women around you keep getting their thongs stuck? I'm starting to get suspicious."
"04","07","42","SETH","Then I will lose it, whatever it... is."
"04","07","42","SETH","All right. Thong emergency."
"04","07","42","SUMMER","That was, like, so brave."
"04","07","42","SANDY","Oh, Julie, how could you do this?"
"04","07","42","JULIE","Please, Sandy, we both know our marriage is a sham. You only married me so I could mastermind your political career. What are you doing with Miss Queen of the North over here?"
"04","07","42","KIRSTEN","Don't you know? He spends all day crying about me at the office."
"04","07","42","SANDY","What are you talking about?"
"04","07","42","KIRSTEN","Everybody knows, Sandy."
"04","07","42","SANDY","In the same way that everybody knows how you go on and on about the mail truck?"
"04","07","42","KIRSTEN","I never told anybody about the mail truck."
"04","07","42","SANDY","Well, not according to her."
"04","07","42","KIRSTEN","Well, she's the girl that told me you spend all day crying."
"04","07","42","RYAN","Uh-oh. Sorry. Apparently, people don't stock clean glasses in the alt-world. What's up?"
"04","07","42","JULIE","Oh, it's the street urchin. I knew not to trust him."
"04","07","42","SANDY","I think you two better start talking."
"04","07","42","RYAN","Absolutely. Taylor?"
"04","07","42","TAYLOR","Oh, don't worry. I know exactly what to say. Okay, people I can explain everything. Sorry."
"04","07","42","RYAN","What?"
"04","07","42","TAYLOR","Just feel a little dizzy. I... Oh, no. Ryan, I think I have to go."
"04","07","42","RYAN","What? What do you mean? It must be because I stood up to my mom. That's what I was here to do. Ryan?"
"04","07","42","RYAN","Yeah?"
"04","07","42","TAYLOR","You have to get everyone together."
"04","07","42","RYAN","No."
"04","07","42","TAYLOR","It's the only way back."
"04","07","42","RYAN","Taylor, no, I can't. Taylor... Just hold on. Taylor?"
"04","07","43","KIRSTEN","Taylor, honey?"
"04","07","43","TAYLOR","You need to be with Sandy Cohen."
"04","07","43","KIRSTEN","I'm going to get the doctor."
"04","07","43","TAYLOR","Come back, Ryan."
"04","07","44","SANDY","So? Are you going to explain yourself?"
"04","07","44","RYAN","The truth is, things the way they are now are completely wrong."
"04","07","44","SUMMER","Who's this random guy we're all listening to? And why am I not drunk yet?"
"04","07","44","RYAN","Okay, look, none of you know me. But, uh, the truth is that each of you saved my life just by being who you are. And right now none of you are who you are. Like Summer, for example. What are you doing?"
"04","07","44","SUMMER","What?"
"04","07","44","RYAN","I mean, Che, Chester, he's, he's completely wrong for you. You should be with Seth. Kirsten, all right, you don't want to run the Newport Group. That place makes you miserable. And you may like your Chardonnay, but I got news for you, it doesn't like you back, and Sandy, you don't want to be mayor. You're all about saving the little guy, not holing up in some mansion, giving orders. What you two are best at is being married to each other."
"04","07","44","JULIE","There he is. Get him out of here."
"04","07","45","KIRSTEN","Hey, Veronica, good news. Taylor's awake, and the doctor said she's going to be fine."
"04","07","45","TAYLOR","Hi, Mom."
"04","07","45","JULIE","Veronica, your daughter is okay. You should be happy."
"04","07","45","TAYLOR","Oh, Julie, it's okay, I got it. Mom, why don't you go to the airport? I bet you could catch the last flight to Cabo."
"04","07","45","TAYLOR","Merry Christmas, Mom."
"04","07","45","KIRSTEN","You okay?"
"04","07","45","TAYLOR","Yeah. I don't know why, but I feel just fine."
"04","07","45","KIRSTEN","Julie? You should see this. I haven't read it."
"04","07","45","JULIE","Oh, my God."
"04","07","46","RYAN","You threw up in it."
"04","07","46","RYAN","Thanks."
"04","07","46","SANDY","I don't know who you are, but a lot of what you said back at the house made sense. So why do you care so much about getting a bunch of strangers back together?"
"04","07","46","RYAN","Well, I guess I thought it would get me back home, too. But I was wrong. Can I ask what happened? How'd your family fall apart?"
"04","07","46","SANDY","I think it all goes back to when Marissa Cooper died three years ago. She was Jimmy and Julie Cooper's daughter."
"04","07","46","RYAN","I knew Marissa."
"04","07","46","SANDY","Well, after she died, it was like everybody got stuck."
"04","07","46","RYAN","Didn't know how to say good-bye?"
"04","07","46","SANDY","Maybe you're right. What are you doing for dinner? How about you come over to the house?"
"04","07","46","RYAN","There's someplace I gotta go. Thanks."
"04","07","46","SANDY","You're welcome."
"04","07","47","KIRSTEN","Oh, I was just calling you. Julie, Summer and Kaitlin are with Taylor. She's awake."
"04","07","47","SETH","What'd you find out?"
"04","07","47","JULIE","This. It's from Marissa. She sent it to Ryan the day she was leaving. I guess it got lost in the mail."
"04","07","47","SANDY","Oh, that's odd."
"04","07","47","SETH","Well, it's Chrismukkah; stranger things have happened."
"04","07","47","SANDY","What's it say?"
"04","07","47","JULIE","Well, that she had to leave Newport. That it was the only way they could get on with their lives. She loved him, but she had to say good-bye."
"04","07","47","KAITLIN","Is that food? Oh, thank God. Between you and me, Taylor in a coma is kind of a nice break."
"04","07","47","SANDY","How you doing, Julie?"
"04","07","47","JULIE","I'm okay. Thanks."
"04","07","48","TAYLOR","Ryan, are you awake?"
"04","07","48","RYAN","Hi."
"04","07","48","TAYLOR","Hi."
"04","07","48","RYAN","I just had the weirdest dream. You were in it, I think."
"04","07","48","TAYLOR","That's so funny. I think you were in my dream, too. I can't remember what it was, though."
"04","07","48","RYAN","Huh. Me, either. I'm really glad you're here."
"04","07","48","SUMMER","Look, the rain stopped."
"04","07","48","SETH","Look who's back in the land of the living."
"04","07","48","KIRSTEN","Oh, Ryan, we were so worried about you. Everything is going to be okay."
"04","07","48","RYAN","Yeah, I know."
"04","08","0","RYAN","Hey, I asked you a question."
"04","08","0","SETH","Yeah, no, it's just some of these bugs are really sort of stubborn. I was using that."
"04","08","0","RYAN","Now you're not. Gonna tell me what's going on?"
"04","08","0","SETH","What if I told you it's New Year's Eve and we're on our way to Vegas?"
"04","08","0","RYAN","I might hit you with this. Why are the girls acting so strange?"
"04","08","0","SETH","I don't... I mean... you know, I don't know."
"04","08","1","SUMMER","How long is it supposed to take?"
"04","08","1","TAYLOR","Five minutes. How long has it been? Okay-- four minutes and 47 seconds."
"04","08","2","RYAN","You're lying. It's written all over you face."
"04","08","2","SETH","Well, then I shouldn't bluff when we get to Las Vegas."
"04","08","2","RYAN","Look... what... man, they're in the bathroom."
"04","08","2","SETH","Why don't you just ask them."
"04","08","3","TAYLOR","13 seconds left."
"04","08","4","RYAN","Do I need to remind you why you're even here right now?"
"04","08","5","SUMMER","11 more seconds."
"04","08","6","SETH","Because you haven't killed me yet?"
"04","08","7","TAYLOR","What if there wasn't enough pee?"
"04","08","8","RYAN","No, because you didn't have any New Year's Even plans so you hijacked mine."
"04","08","9","SUMMER","How many bars am I looking for?"
"04","08","9","TAYLOR","Two, two bars. Six more seconds."
"04","08","10","SETH","I told you I'd pay you back."
"04","08","11","SUMMER","Oh, my God, I can't look."
"04","08","12","RYAN","And now I'm collecting. So tell me what's happening."
"04","08","13","TAYLOR","Oh, my God, three more seconds, two more seconds, one more second..."
"04","08","14","RYAN","Here you go."
"04","08","14","SETH","Last coffee of '06. How much you hoping I don't make that joke all day?"
"04","08","14","RYAN","Not like I'll be around to hear it."
"04","08","14","SETH","So walk me through your itinerary again."
"04","08","14","RYAN","I've got breakfast with Taylor. Back home to pack, quick lunch, off to Vegas."
"04","08","14","SETH","She still doesn't know you're taking her?"
"04","08","14","RYAN","Well, that's why it's a surprise."
"04","08","15","TAYLOR","He's told me nothing. And I just thought. you know,since he went to all of this trouble it would be nice for me to surprise him, too, and... Summer, are you even listening to me?"
"04","08","15","SUMMER","What? No... yeah... every word."
"04","08","15","TAYLOR","'Cause you seem kind of out of it."
"04","08","15","SUMMER","I'm sorry, I'm just still waking up."
"04","08","16","SETH","You guys seem pretty serious, though? It's that old adage- couples who have comas together, stay together."
"04","08","16","RYAN","She won't think Vegas is cheesy, will she?"
"04","08","17","TAYLOR","Do you think it's cheesy to get him lingerie? Obviously, I'm going to be wearing it, but it's really for him."
"04","08","17","SUMMER","Look, Taylor... You're right."
"04","08","17","TAYLOR","It's way too soon for lingerie. Is he going to think I'm some kind of kinky, sex-starved, divorcee?"
"04","08","17","SUMMER","You're being paranoid."
"04","08","18","SETH","Still, be careful, 'cause people, they go to Vegas and they come back married."
"04","08","18","RYAN","What about you and Summer-- any plans?"
"04","08","19","SUMMER","Well, if it's a typical night for us, I'm probably in for some Korean cinema, manga and making new friends on MySpace."
"04","08","19","TAYLOR","In other words..."
"04","08","20","SETH","No ""plans""-- that's a dirty word. That's right up there with ""responsibility"" and ""future."" There'll be plenty of time for that when we're in college."
"04","08","20","RYAN","And she's on board with that?"
"04","08","20","SETH","Totally."
"04","08","21","SUMMER","I hope I don't have to kill him. When are you meeting Ryan?"
"04","08","22","RYAN","Ooh, now. All right, I will see you tomorrow."
"04","08","22","SETH","Happy New Year."
"04","08","23","TAYLOR","Happy New Year, Summer."
"04","08","23","SUMMER","Same to you. Good luck tonight. I'm sure everything will just be great."
"04","08","23","TAYLOR","Oh, speak of the devil."
"04","08","23","RYAN","Summer."
"04","08","23","SUMMER","Atwood."
"04","08","23","RYAN","Taylor."
"04","08","23","TAYLOR","Hi."
"04","08","23","RYAN","You looking forward to your surprise tonight?"
"04","08","23","TAYLOR","I am. Are you looking forward to yours?"
"04","08","23","RYAN","I am."
"04","08","23","SUMMER","Ew. That's my cue."
"04","08","23","TAYLOR","Okay, here it is."
"04","08","23","RYAN","What is it?"
"04","08","23","TAYLOR","Open it."
"04","08","24","SETH","Hey."
"04","08","24","SUMMER","Hi. I wanted to talk to you about what we're doing tonight."
"04","08","24","SETH","Why talk when actions speak so much louder than words."
"04","08","24","SUMMER","What is it?"
"04","08","24","SETH","I don't know. Just open it."
"04","08","24","SUMMER","Okay."
"04","08","25","RYAN","Oh, my..."
"04","08","25","TAYLOR","Surprise."
"04","08","26","SUMMER","""Jamaican me crazy."""
"04","08","26","SETH","It's funny because it's not."
"04","08","27","TAYLOR","Do you think I'm a whore?"
"04","08","27","RYAN","What? No, no. It's just... I already have this."
"04","08","27","TAYLOR","You nut. For a second there, I was like, oh, major miscalculation."
"04","08","27","RYAN","No, no, no. It's going to be a great night. All right, come here."
"04","08","28","SUMMER","Yeah... You didn't make any plans for us tonight, did you?"
"04","08","28","SETH","Well, I thought we would just..."
"04","08","28","SUMMER","What ""Jamaican"" up as you go? You are such a baby. I'm done baby-sitting you. Do you understand me? I'm done."
"04","08","29","JULIE","I'm not questioning the fantasy, Spencer. We've all imagined doing it with the delivery boy. I am questioning whether we should be paying for the pizza. It's starting to add up."
"04","08","29","JULIE","Hey, who did we...? Who'd we set Petrie Marchand up with?"
"04","08","29","JULIE","Oh, yeah. My real question-- what do you know about money laundering?"
"04","08","29","JULIE","Because it's the holidays and we're busy and I can't keep filing all this cash under ""extra money."" I'll, um... I'll see you later at the place."
"04","08","29","KIRSTEN","That was Jimmy on the phone. He's supposed to call Kaitlin at midnight?"
"04","08","29","JULIE","Yeah."
"04","08","29","KIRSTEN","Well, he's hosting a party on his boat. And he wanted you to tell Kaitlin he's sorry, but he might be out of cell phone range."
"04","08","29","JULIE","Poor Kaitlin. I know she doesn't show it, but I think she really, really misses him."
"04","08","29","KIRSTEN","Can I help you with something?"
"04","08","29","JULIE","No, no. No, I'm good."
"04","08","29","KIRSTEN","Julie, I appreciate you handling the bookkeeping, but honestly, I probably have more experience."
"04","08","29","JULIE","Well... all the more reason for me to learn. I mean, what if you get hit by a bus or something? God forbid."
"04","08","29","KIRSTEN","There must be something I can do."
"04","08","29","JULIE","Some more coffee? I got it at the place on the corner."
"04","08","29","GORDON","Somebody going on a coffee run? I'll take a latte. Hello, sweetheart. Just thought I'd drop off an invite to my soiree."
"04","08","29","JULIE","Yeah, Gordon, you know, I received like 11 of these in the mail."
"04","08","29","GORDON","Well, now you've got an even dozen. So read it to me."
"04","08","29","JULIE","""Gordon Bullit invites you and a hot guest to start 2007 with a bang."""
"04","08","29","GORDON","That joke never gets old, does it? Been using it since 1989. So, uh... what time do you want me to send a limo?"
"04","08","29","JULIE","You know, honestly, I'm not sure that I'll get through with everything here."
"04","08","29","GORDON","Damn it, hotcakes, when I bankrolled this operation, I thought I'd see you more, not less. Since I got back from Riyadh, we've had two dinner dates and zero hanky-panky."
"04","08","29","JULIE","Well, it's a new business, Gordon."
"04","08","29","GORDON","Well, hey, look, at least let me get you a bean counter to take care of some of the paperwork."
"04","08","29","JULIE","Bullit, let me have that back."
"04","08","29","GORDON","Wow, you girls eat a mess of pizza."
"04","08","29","JULIE","We work through dinner a lot. Look, I really appreciate the gesture, Bullit, but I would prefer to do this on my own, hmm?"
"04","08","29","GORDON","Okay. You coming tonight?"
"04","08","29","JULIE","If I can."
"04","08","29","GORDON","Damn, woman."
"04","08","30","SANDY","And he requested me? Yeah, all right, all right. I'll see what I can do. Okay."
"04","08","30","SETH","Working on New Year's Eve?"
"04","08","30","SANDY","Yeah, one of your homeless guys from Thanksgiving attacked a parking meter. He couldn't remember his name, but he remembered mine."
"04","08","30","SETH","I was talking about the sandwiches."
"04","08","30","SANDY","Oh, yeah, Ryan's putting together a cooler for Vegas. I'm his sandwich guy. Cohens are natural sandwich artists."
"04","08","30","SETH","It's like our very own super power. Yeah, I don't know if it qualifies us for the Justice League, though."
"04","08","30","SANDY","What's up? You've got that ""something's up"" look on your face."
"04","08","30","SETH","Well, you know, probably 'cause something's up."
"04","08","30","SANDY","What'd you do?"
"04","08","30","SETH","More like what I didn't do. Turns out Summer's expecting me to make some elaborate New Year's Eve plans."
"04","08","30","SANDY","Oh, romantic holiday plans- definitely not a Cohen super power."
"04","08","30","SETH","We've got nine months until we go to college. This is the last time in our lives we don't have to worry about stuff."
"04","08","30","SANDY","Yeah, yeah, the ladies don't really buy that line, though. You still have to show her that you value her. My advice... Put some thought and effort into making some real New Year's Eve plans, pronto. Well, my work here is done. I've got a date with a bail bondsman. And you and Summer have a wonderful New Year's Eve. And... be safe."
"04","08","30","RYAN","Hey."
"04","08","30","SANDY","Hey. You be safe, too, in Vegas, will ya?"
"04","08","30","RYAN","Yeah."
"04","08","30","SANDY","The sandwiches are all ready. Good to go. And if I do say so myself, they're great."
"04","08","30","RYAN","Thank you, Sandy."
"04","08","30","SANDY","The only thing you have to keep in mind-- make it personal."
"04","08","30","SETH","I think I just got the purr-fect idea."
"04","08","30","SANDY","Good man."
"04","08","30","RYAN","What was that about?"
"04","08","30","SETH","Oh, nothing-- just Summer and I coming with you to Vegas."
"04","08","30","RYAN","What?!"
"04","08","30","SETH","You may want to make some more sandwiches. I'm going to go upstairs and pack."
"04","08","31","JULIE","You're late."
"04","08","31","JULIE","What book?"
"04","08","31","JULIE","This has got to be a sign."
"04","08","31","JULIE","Your father tried to saddle me with an accountant today. What if he finds out we've turned his investment into a whorehouse? Or if Kirsten finds out? No, we need to shut this down now."
"04","08","31","JULIE","We can manage without."
"04","08","31","JULIE","We'll burn everything tomorrow."
"04","08","32","GORDON","Frank, Frank, Frank. Damn, damn, double damn. Good to see you."
"04","08","32","FRANK","Good to see you. Come on in. Have a seat. Can I fix you a drink?"
"04","08","32","GORDON","No, I'm fine. So, cowboy, what the hell you doing in these neck of the woods?"
"04","08","32","FRANK","Well, you... you once said, if I ever needed a job..."
"04","08","32","GORDON","Serious? Now, don't be jerking the Bullit around."
"04","08","32","FRANK","I'm serious."
"04","08","32","GORDON","Well, now, that's a good thing. And I happen to have a couple of places I could use you pronto. But, knowing you, you've already picked something out."
"04","08","32","FRANK","You're not going to believe this, but I saw you invested in a dating service."
"04","08","32","GORDON","You're kidding, right? A man of your talents?"
"04","08","32","FRANK","I think there's a future in it."
"04","08","32","GORDON","Yeah, but the tricky thing there is, my girlfriend, Julie-- she's kind of running that."
"04","08","32","FRANK","Really?"
"04","08","32","GORDON","I know what you're thinking, but it's not like that barmaid in Daytona. Now, that one, she was a con artist."
"04","08","32","FRANK","And Julie's legit?"
"04","08","32","GORDON","Absolutely."
"04","08","32","FRANK","I mean, Julie's problem is not thievery. It's pride. She wants to do everything herself, and I get no chance to see her. Oh, wait. Bullit. Oh, right. The dress shop. Okay. On the way. Sorry. I got to go. Well, it was good to see you. You're going to love Newport."
"04","08","32","FRANK","I'm sure I will. Oh, and if Julie ever gets less proud, you let me know. I'd love to help out."
"04","08","32","GORDON","I'll do that. Happy New Year, partner."
"04","08","32","FRANK","Same to you."
"04","08","32","GORDON","See you later."
"04","08","32","FRANK","Right."
"04","08","33","SUMMER","Taylor, you look terrible. What's the matter?"
"04","08","33","TAYLOR","Okay, can you keep a secret? But I mean a big secret. Like, a really big secret."
"04","08","33","SUMMER","Yeah."
"04","08","33","TAYLOR","I think you might be pregnant."
"04","08","33","SUMMER","Um... okay. First of all, if I were pregnant, that would be my secret. And second of all, I'm late, not pregnant."
"04","08","33","TAYLOR","And how did you know that? Okay, when I went to visit you in Providence, I remember that you had your period, which means you should have had it again a week and a half ago. But the box of tampons that you bought two weeks ago hasn't even been opened. Summer, have you had unsafe s*x?"
"04","08","33","SUMMER","Well, there was that time where Seth visited..."
"04","08","33","TAYLOR","Summer..."
"04","08","33","SUMMER","I didn't want the pharmaceutical companies playing slumlord with my eggs."
"04","08","33","TAYLOR","Well, what about condoms?"
"04","08","33","SUMMER","Latex smells funny."
"04","08","33","TAYLOR","So do diapers."
"04","08","33","SUMMER","Taylor!"
"04","08","33","TAYLOR","What? Don't pretend you're not worried about this, because you've been preoccupied all day."
"04","08","33","SUMMER","I am not pregnant."
"04","08","33","TAYLOR","Hmm. Well, prove it."
"04","08","33","SUMMER","Get that away from me."
"04","08","33","SETH","Hey, you decent?"
"04","08","33","TAYLOR","Seth, actually, Summer and I were just having a little girl time, so if you could just come back in 15..."
"04","08","33","SUMMER","It's so good to see you!"
"04","08","33","SETH","Hey, wow! Look at all this affection, and I haven't even told you my surprise yet. Though, to be fair, it's really more of Ryan's surprise."
"04","08","33","SUMMER","Seth."
"04","08","33","SETH","But, yes, the four of us are going to Las Vegas. Ryan is in the car, waiting."
"04","08","33","TAYLOR","Ryan's taking me to Vegas?"
"04","08","33","SETH","And I'm taking you, Mrs. What-Are-Our- Plans-For-New Year's. Now, why don't you to get packed so we can get on the road."
"04","08","33","TAYLOR","Actually, Summer and I just need to dash into the bathroom really quick and..."
"04","08","33","SUMMER","That is a great idea. That is the best idea ever! Why don't you help me pick out what to bring?"
"04","08","33","SETH","Okay."
"04","08","33","TAYLOR","Okay, well, I'm just going to pack this toothpaste because we might want it"
"04","08","34","TAYLOR","Hey, Ryan, can we stop soon? Summer and I have to pee."
"04","08","34","RYAN","Oh, yeah? Sure. You know what? Next chance we get, I'll get some gas."
"04","08","34","TAYLOR","Great."
"04","08","34","TAYLOR","Summer, I think, when we stop, we should try out our new toothpaste. Breath's a little stale."
"04","08","34","SETH","Ryan, are you ready for a sandwich? Hmm? Listen, I know we're crashing, but I promise you, soon as we get to Vegas, I'm going to buy you the best room Sandy Cohen's money can buy. You're rescuing me, and I want to pay you back."
"04","08","34","RYAN","Yeah, all right."
"04","08","34","TAYLOR","Hey, Seth, hypothetically speaking, if I was your girlfriend, and I had health issues, would you want to know about them?"
"04","08","34","SETH","Um... I don't know. What kind of health issues?"
"04","08","34","SUMMER","Diarrhea of the mouth. Can we just, like, stop talking and turn the music up and just drive, please?"
"04","08","34","TAYLOR","Summer, there is something in your hair. Let me get it out for you."
"04","08","34","SUMMER","What are you doing?"
"04","08","34","TAYLOR","I think you need to tell Seth."
"04","08","34","SUMMER","No. I don't think he could handle it."
"04","08","34","TAYLOR","How do you know?"
"04","08","34","SETH","Aw, crap! Forgot my toothbrush. I'm going to have to use my finger."
"04","08","34","SUMMER","See? He's a child."
"04","08","34","SETH","Did you get a toothbrush, too?"
"04","08","34","TAYLOR","Seth! Don't...! Oh. Is this...?"
"04","08","34","TAYLOR","Mine! My toothpaste."
"04","08","34","RYAN","What's going on?"
"04","08","34","TAYLOR","Nothing. It's just this is... extra whitening, and Seth needs tartar control. Badly."
"04","08","34","SUMMER","Thank you."
"04","08","34","TAYLOR","You're welcome."
"04","08","35","KAITLIN","Mom?"
"04","08","35","GORDON","Okay, the coast is clear, dude. Yeah. She's probably still at work. You sure we did the right thing but not buying that little number with rhinestones?"
"04","08","35","GORDON","You asked me for my help to pick out a dress for my mother, so trust me."
"04","08","35","GORDON","Well, I just want to make sure she feels like a million dollars at my party tonight, that's all. That's assuming she finishes work on time. I offered to get someone inthere to help the woman out. She flat out refused me."
"04","08","35","KAITLIN","You really like her, don't you?"
"04","08","35","GORDON","Oh, yeah, peanut. She's under my skin. The whole time I was in Riyadh, didn't once try to peek under a girl's burkha. So, uh... what you got going on tonight?"
"04","08","35","KAITLIN","Well, I'm supposed to talk to my dad, but his boat's out of cellphone range. So, whatever. It's no big."
"04","08","35","GORDON","Well, dang, girl, if you're free, why not come to my party?"
"04","08","35","KAITLIN","Because I'm 40?"
"04","08","35","GORDON","No, because it's New Year's Eve, and I got not one prince, but two coming."
"04","08","35","KAITLIN","William and Harry?"
"04","08","35","GORDON","Mm-mm-- Samir and Abbas. Saudis. About your age, and not a bad catch, if you don't mind raisins in your chicken. You like two-steppin'? It's a dance we do in Texas-- I can show you tonight if you'd like."
"04","08","35","KAITLIN","You can hold your breath for that."
"04","08","35","GORDON","All right. Well, I appreciate your help. You take care now."
"04","08","35","KAITLIN","Ignore her."
"04","08","35","GORDON","Come again?"
"04","08","35","KAITLIN","She refused your help, so ignore her. It's what I always do."
"04","08","35","GORDON","Here you go."
"04","08","35","KAITLIN","What's this for?"
"04","08","35","GORDON","In case you change your mind, come to the party, you might want to buy a dress or a lollipop or something. Yo, Frank. Yeah, Bullit. What's going on this afternoon?"
"04","08","36","TAYLOR","It's up to you."
"04","08","36","SUMMER","You'll be there when I take it?"
"04","08","36","TAYLOR","Of course."
"04","08","36","SUMMER","Let's go."
"04","08","36","RYAN","Hey, uh... is everything all right? You, uh... were acting kind of strange in the car. Okay, I just wanted to, uh, you know, apologize. I know this trip to Vegas is supposed to be us, but Seth kindof hijacked it to get out of the doghouse, so what are you going to do?"
"04","08","36","TAYLOR","Yeah, I know."
"04","08","36","RYAN","Uh... anyway, you know, he, uh... he's getting us a room. So at least we'll be alone."
"04","08","36","TAYLOR","Yeah. Uh... I don't think that we should do that. In fact, I know that we shouldn't."
"04","08","36","RYAN","Uh... What... what are you talking about?"
"04","08","36","TAYLOR","Obviously, we both thoughtthat we were going to... It's Vegas, and there's lingerie, and it would be great, trust me, but I just want our first time to be special, and tonight is just not the night. Okay? Sorry. I got to go."
"04","08","37","SETH","I have a question. And let's pretend I wasn't eavesdropping. Are you absolutely positive that you haven't had s*x yet with Taylor? Not even, like a, ""I feel guilty about this because you're kind of wasted, but how did that happen?"" mistake? Okay, I'll take that as a no. Hey, look at that. It's a green alien. It's crazy. Well, these windows aren't going to wash themselves."
"04","08","37","RYAN","Seth, what's going on?"
"04","08","38","TAYLOR","Okay, ""Remove the test stick from the foil wrapper."""
"04","08","38","SUMMER","Did that already."
"04","08","38","TAYLOR","""Position the stick with the test windows ""facing away from the urine stream, ""and place the absorbent tip under the stream of urine."" Stream of urine, Summer."
"04","08","38","TAYLOR","Oh, no. Thank you."
"04","08","38","SUMMER","Who is it?"
"04","08","38","TAYLOR","A slutty alien. Did you pee? I'll go outside."
"04","08","38","SUMMER","Wait, wait. Don't leave me."
"04","08","39","JULIE","May I help you?"
"04","08","39","FRANK","You must be Julie."
"04","08","39","JULIE","And you are...?"
"04","08","39","GORDON","I told you she was hot. Julie, meet my buddy Frank. He's gonna put yourbooks in order."
"04","08","39","JULIE","Didn't I say no to this?"
"04","08","39","GORDON","Oh, yes, you did, but a little birdie told me to ignore you, so that's what I'm doing."
"04","08","39","JULIE","Gordon..."
"04","08","39","GORDON","Is no longer willing to negotiate. Now, let's let Frank do his thing. Meantime, let's get you out of that Pilgrim outfit and into a ball gown, which I happen to have bought you. And, Frank, if you get finished by midnight, you come play with us, you hear?"
"04","08","39","FRANK","I will."
"04","08","39","GORDON","Oh, Julie. It was nice meeting you."
"04","08","39","JULIE","Nice meeting you, too, Frank."
"04","08","39","GORDON","Come on, sweetie."
"04","08","40","RYAN","Why are the girls acting so strange?"
"04","08","40","SETH","Dude, I don't, you know..."
"04","08","41","SUMMER","12 more seconds. 11 more seconds."
"04","08","41","TAYLOR","What if there wasn't enough pee?"
"04","08","41","SUMMER","Ten seconds."
"04","08","41","TAYLOR","Here, let's switch."
"04","08","41","SUMMER","How many bars am I looking for?"
"04","08","41","TAYLOR","Two. Two bars. Oh, my God, four more seconds."
"04","08","41","SUMMER","Oh, my God, I can't look."
"04","08","41","TAYLOR","Three more seconds. two more seconds... Oh, my God. one more second."
"04","08","41","SUMMER","Okay, I can't do it. Just don't look at it, I can't breathe..."
"04","08","41","TAYLOR","Okay, okay... Sit down. Sit down, sit down."
"04","08","41","SUMMER","I can't breathe. Here, breathe, breathe."
"04","08","41","TAYLOR","Breathe into this. Breathe deep breaths. Look, Summer, I'm not gonna make you do anything. It's totally your decision. But whatever you do, it doesn't change the truth, and-and in a few hours, it's gonna be the new year. Do you want to start that year as an adult, with your eyes wide open, or... with your head in the sand?"
"04","08","41","SUMMER","Give it to me."
"04","08","41","TAYLOR","Oh, my God."
"04","08","41","SUMMER","What?"
"04","08","41","TAYLOR","It's gone."
"04","08","41","SUMMER","What?!"
"04","08","42","RYAN","I don't believe it."
"04","08","42","SETH","Well, do you think she cheated on you?"
"04","08","42","RYAN","No. I mean, I-I can't believe she didn't tell me."
"04","08","42","SETH","Well, I'll wash the car if you want to go smash something. Like maybe that big green bug."
"04","08","42","TAYLOR","Hey! Excuse me! I... You... Follow that alien! She stole my purse!"
"04","08","42","SETH","What?"
"04","08","42","TAYLOR","She just stole my purse."
"04","08","42","TAYLOR","What? Well... Get in the car! She just stole it from underneath the bathroom. Seth, hurry up ! She's getting... She's right there! Go Ryan, go! Go!"
"04","08","43","SETH","Can't we just buy you a new purse and cancel your credit cards?"
"04","08","43","SUMMER","No, we need that purse."
"04","08","43","SETH","Why?"
"04","08","43","TAYLOR","Because... Of the pills that I have in there. For the allergy I have but never told you guys about. It's just... nothing serious."
"04","08","43","SUMMER","And she needs to take the pills before midnight."
"04","08","43","TAYLOR","Right. And since we are in the middle of the desert, and nowhere near a pharmacy, it has to be the pills in that purse. Sorry. You're being awfully quiet."
"04","08","43","RYAN","There's a lot of that going around."
"04","08","43","SUMMER","Hey, I see brake lights."
"04","08","43","SETH","look liked"
"04","08","44","SUMMER","Did anyone get a good look at her face?"
"04","08","44","SETH","She's an alien-- it's not an easy thing to lose in a crowd."
"04","08","44","TAYLOR","I don't believe it."
"04","08","44","SUMMER","Everyone is an alien."
"04","08","44","SETH","Hey, we're gonna go this way."
"04","08","44","RYAN","Okay, we'll go this way."
"04","08","44","TAYLOR","But..."
"04","08","44","RYAN","Come on. I promised you some alone time."
"04","08","45","JULIE","Hey."
"04","08","45","JULIE","Spencer, let me ask you a question. When you paired these ladies up with their dates, did you know they were coming to this party?"
"04","08","45","JULIE","No, no. I think we're taking the fish and slapping her in the face with it. She knows these women are our clients."
"04","08","45","JULIE","Recovering, unfortunately. So did you find anything out about Frank?"
"04","08","45","JULIE","So what do you think?"
"04","08","45","JULIE","No, Deep Throat, I mean, what do you think we should do? Does he seem like someone we can bribe?"
"04","08","45","JULIE","He's over there introducing Kaitlin to some Saudi princes."
"04","08","46","GORDON","This is Samir-- and I call him Sam. And this is Abbas-- and I call him Boss."
"04","08","46","KAITLIN","Oh."
"04","08","46","KAITLIN","Kaitlin."
"04","08","46","GORDON","Kaitlin. Okay, Kaitland."
"04","08","47","TAYLOR","He says there's no coat-check, and there's no one really in charge. Oh, then he invited me to party on his asteroid, which I think means his trailer. Maybe we should just find Seth and Summer and make sure they're okay."
"04","08","47","RYAN","Taylor, I... I know. Seth told me."
"04","08","47","TAYLOR","Told you what?"
"04","08","47","RYAN","You know... it, the thing."
"04","08","47","TAYLOR","Okay, let me explain..."
"04","08","47","RYAN","I just wish that you told me. That's what I'm mad about, not any of the other stuff, just that you kept it from me."
"04","08","47","TAYLOR","Wait, wh-what other stuff?"
"04","08","47","RYAN","Well, you know, that you were... sleeping with someone before we started dating."
"04","08","47","TAYLOR","Who says?"
"04","08","47","SETH","Well, the math says, but, look, I'm not mad about that."
"04","08","47","TAYLOR","See, I knew you felt this way."
"04","08","47","RYAN","Well, I'm not... I'm not accusing you of anything."
"04","08","47","TAYLOR","Yes, you are. You are saying that I had random unsafe s*x with someone in between my marriage annulment and us making out at Kaitlin's. Do you know how many days that was, Ryan?"
"04","08","47","RYAN","So what are you saying? You're saying you were sleeping with someone while we were dating?"
"04","08","47","TAYLOR","Is that what you think?"
"04","08","47","RYAN","No! But if you were, I couldn't be mad because we were never exclusive."
"04","08","47","TAYLOR","Right. And why would you want to be, since you clearly think I am a big fat divorcee whore!"
"04","08","48","JULIE","Oh, my God."
"04","08","48","JULIE","Hi. Hey. Uh, where's Sandy?"
"04","08","48","KIRSTEN","Julie, what's going on?"
"04","08","48","JULIE","What do you mean?"
"04","08","48","KIRSTEN","Well, it's just that all our clients here are on dates with people that look like they're college students-- I mean, weren't we supposed to set up Jessica Rogers with Dr. Weston?"
"04","08","48","JULIE","Yeah, you know, we were, but she called yesterday and said she met someone-- that's love."
"04","08","48","FRANK","Hello, Julie."
"04","08","48","JULIE","Frank... uh, you're here. Uh... Frank, this is Kirsten Cohen, my partner. This is Frank..."
"04","08","48","FRANK","Perry. Frank Perry. Nice to meet you."
"04","08","48","KIRSTEN","Nice to meet you."
"04","08","48","JULIE","Frank Perry. Right. Um... Bullit hired him to put our books in order, and that's what he's been doing all night so that I could be here."
"04","08","48","KIRSTEN","Oh. Does everything add up?"
"04","08","48","FRANK","Yeah. Looks good. And business seems to be booming, so... if I had a drink, I-I would toast you."
"04","08","48","JULIE","Well, I'll-I'll take it anyway. Thank you."
"04","08","48","FRANK","All right, ladies, as you were. Kirsten, a pleasure to meet you."
"04","08","48","JULIE","Ah, Kiki, do you ever feel invincible."
"04","08","48","KIRSTEN","Why?"
"04","08","48","JULIE","Oh... no reason. Happy New Year, sweetie."
"04","08","49","SETH","Remind me again why we're looking for a purse when the larger issue seems to be Taylor thinking she has a baby inside of her? And don't give me anything about any allergy pills, 'cause I'm not buying it."
"04","08","49","SUMMER","Seth, we need the purse, because the pregnancy test is in it. The test that we have already taken and haven't looked at yet. The test that we need to see before midnight so we can start 2007 knowing exactly where we stand."
"04","08","49","SETH","Can I interrupt you for a second? I'm remembering something I wanted to ask you for back in the car when I found out the test was Taylor's."
"04","08","49","SUMMER","What?"
"04","08","49","SETH","Paw. Up top."
"04","08","50","SETH","Can you imagine if it was your test we're looking for? Now, I know it seems a little bit selfish, but I think we're entitled to celebrate, so come on, up top, hit it. Hit it."
"04","08","50","SUMMER","God, Seth."
"04","08","50","SETH","Oh, God. Oh, my God! It's really you!"
"04","08","50","SETH","Oh."
"04","08","50","SETH","Thanks. Thanks a lot."
"04","08","50","SETH","Oh, wow, that is fantastic. Listen, I'm looking..."
"04","08","50","SETH","Oh, oh, okay."
"04","08","50","SETH","Wow, thanks a lot. Hey, oh, it's the alien!"
"04","08","50","SETH","Thanks a lot."
"04","08","51","FRANK","I didn't want to embarrass you in front of your partner, but your so-called dating service... is not exactly what Bullit thought he was investing in, is it? Why don't you wet your lips. Your mouth looks dry."
"04","08","51","KAITLIN","What?"
"04","08","51","KAITLIN","Yeah, y-you guys go do that."
"04","08","52","JULIE","Okay, so just what do I have to do to keep you quiet?"
"04","08","52","FRANK","Suite 522 at the Four Seasons. Say... half an hour."
"04","08","53","KIRSTEN","Oh, there you are. How's your client?"
"04","08","53","SANDY","Darrel? Well, he's better off than the parking meter he beheaded. I sent him to a shelter. How has your night been?"
"04","08","53","KIRSTEN","Oh, it's just... it's just odd. Julie's acting strange, and... well, we have clients here-- it's just they're not with the dates that we set them up with. So if I'm a little tense I apologize."
"04","08","53","SANDY","Come on, let's work it out on the dance floor."
"04","08","53","KIRSTEN","Yeah."
"04","08","53","FRANK","Oh, oh, I'm sorry."
"04","08","53","SANDY","No, my fault. Sandy Cohen."
"04","08","53","FRANK","Uh, Frank Perry."
"04","08","53","KIRSTEN","Frank works for Bullit."
"04","08","53","SANDY","Oh, is that right?"
"04","08","53","FRANK","Yeah, the Big Bang himself. Well, it was nice bumping into you. And, uh, happy New Year."
"04","08","53","SANDY","You, too."
"04","08","53","KIRSTEN","Sandy, something wrong?"
"04","08","53","SANDY","I feel like I know that guy from somewhere. Come on. How about that dance?"
"04","08","54","GORDON","Hey there, Miss Columbus. How are you? Good to see you. Hey, now, enjoy yourself."
"04","08","55","KAITLIN","Mom, aren't you gonna stay for midnight?"
"04","08","55","JULIE","Oh, Kaitlin, your mom has a headache. But you should stay-- have Bullit give you a ride home."
"04","08","55","KAITLIN","This doesn't have anything to do with that creepy guy, does it?"
"04","08","55","JULIE","What creepy guy?"
"04","08","55","KAITLIN","They guy I saw you talking to. You were gonna go meet him, weren't you?"
"04","08","55","JULIE","This is not what you think. But, please, you can't tell Bullit about this."
"04","08","55","KAITLIN","Mom, he really likes you."
"04","08","55","JULIE","And-and I really like him, too. It just... You have to trust me on this, okay?"
"04","08","55","KAITLIN","Okay."
"04","08","55","JULIE","Happy New Year, baby."
"04","08","55","KAITLIN","Uh, Mom? I miss Dad sometimes."
"04","08","55","JULIE","I know, honey. We'll call him tomorrow, okay?"
"04","08","55","KAITLIN","Okay."
"04","08","56","RYAN","Taylor!"
"04","08","56","TAYLOR","Hey, Ryan. What are you doing?"
"04","08","56","RYAN","Let's go."
"04","08","56","TAYLOR","Ryan, you think I'm a whore, I'm gonna act like a whore."
"04","08","56","RYAN","I don't think you're a whore, but I definitely don't think you should be drinking."
"04","08","56","TAYLOR","Why, because I might be pregnant with my whore baby?"
"04","08","56","RYAN","How about you just back off?"
"04","08","56","SUMMER","Hey, what's going on? What are you doing?"
"04","08","56","RYAN","I'm trying to figure out why my girlfriend is taking pregnancy tests and I'm the last one to find out about it. How is that possible?"
"04","08","56","SUMMER","Because it's not hers, okay? It's mine. It's my test that is in Taylor's purse."
"04","08","56","RYAN","What?"
"04","08","56","SUMMER","Great. This is great. Now I'm not gonna know if I'm pregnant before midnight. There's nothing like starting off a new near with something like this hanging over your head. Happy New Year, Ryan."
"04","08","56","SETH","Ryan! Dude, it's Summer's."
"04","08","56","RYAN","I know. Come on. Let's go."
"04","08","57","SETH","Come on. Wait a minute! Come back! Come on! Are you kidding me?!"
"04","08","58","RYAN","All right, thanks. Nearest cab company's in Baker. What do you want to do now?"
"04","08","58","SETH","Oh, curl up into the fetal position and weep. Although, perhaps the unborn baby metaphor..."
"04","08","58","RYAN","Not really appropriate."
"04","08","58","SETH","I cannot believe Summer might be pregnant. Oh, my God. I think I saw an empty..."
"04","08","58","RYAN","Uh, Seth. Hurry up."
"04","08","59","TAYLOR","Don't worry, Summer. I'm sure we'll pass a 24-hour pharmacy at some point."
"04","08","59","SUMMER","The symbolism window closed at midnight. We'll do it in the morning."
"04","08","59","TAYLOR","Okay."
"04","08","59","SUMMER","Taylor, I really appreciate everything you did for me today. I really hope it didn't cause any permanent damage with you and Ryan."
"04","08","59","TAYLOR","Oh, don't worry about me, please."
"04","08","59","SUMMER","How did I get here ? How did I go from being an Ivy League Al Gore in the making to a knocked-up college dropout with a boyfriend that forgets to pack his toothbrush when he travels? How did this happen?"
"04","08","59","TAYLOR","You know what? It's a new year. We all get a fresh start. Okay? You and me and Seth and Ryan, we can all be whatever we want to be. And everything negative will be left in last year."
"04","08","61","SUMMER","It was kind of mean leaving them in there like that, wasn't it?"
"04","08","61","TAYLOR","Yeah."
"04","08","61","SUMMER","Yeah."
"04","08","61","TAYLOR","I'll call 'em, see if they're okay. I need to borrow your phone. I left mine in my purse."
"04","08","62","SETH","Hey! Hey, these alien chicks are really easy. Hey, we need an emergency evacuation."
"04","08","62","SETH","We have to go!"
"04","08","63","KIRSTEN","All set?"
"04","08","63","SANDY","What?"
"04","08","63","KIRSTEN","You still thinking about Frank?"
"04","08","63","SANDY","I can't shake the feeling that I know him."
"04","08","63","KIRSTEN","I wish you did. I'd love to know who Julie has going through our books."
"04","08","63","SANDY","She never said anything. Nothing about where Bullit found him?"
"04","08","63","SANDY","Yeah. No, no. I'm going to swing by the homeless shelter make sure Daryl made it there."
"04","08","63","KIRSTEN","Are you sure?"
"04","08","63","SANDY","Yeah, I won't be long."
"04","08","64","RYAN","Look, as scared as you are, I'm sure Summer's ten times more scared."
"04","08","64","RYAN","Exactly. And you can start by telling her how you feel."
"04","08","64","SETH","Well, kinda depends on what's in this purse."
"04","08","64","RYAN","Does it? It is going to change whether or not you want to be with her?"
"04","08","64","SETH","No, of course not."
"04","08","64","RYAN","And can you imagine ever not wanting to be with her?"
"04","08","64","SETH","No."
"04","08","64","RYAN","That's your answer."
"04","08","65","KAITLIN","Hey, great party."
"04","08","65","GORDON","Thank you, Peanut. How'd it go with the Saudis?"
"04","08","65","KAITLIN","Well, they want to fly me over to Dubai for their prom but I said there's no way I want to wear one of those Klan outfits."
"04","08","65","GORDON","I don't blame you. Have you seen your mother? I've been, I've been looking for her."
"04","08","65","KAITLIN","Um, she went home. She had a migraine."
"04","08","65","GORDON","Dang, I wish she'd have told me. Well, I hope she's okay."
"04","08","65","KAITLIN","So what was that dance that you were talking to me about this afternoon?"
"04","08","65","GORDON","The one with the number? That'd be the Texas Two-Step."
"04","08","65","KAITLIN","Can you show it to me?"
"04","08","65","GORDON","Is the Pope Catholic? Oh, come on, lucky lady. It's your night. Here we go. Ready? And it's one, two, one, two, back step. One, two, one, two, Texas Two-Step. We got it. And you're turning."
"04","08","65","KAITLIN","I'm turning?"
"04","08","65","GORDON","You're turning. Come on. Turn this way. That a girl. Whoa! I nearly lost you. We got it. Got it, got it."
"04","08","66","TAYLOR","If you're here for s*x, there's, like, five guys ahead of you."
"04","08","66","RYAN","Okay, look, I'm sorry if I jumped to conclusions tonight. But you can't be paranoid either about being divorced or any of it. It doesn't mean anything to me."
"04","08","66","TAYLOR","So you don't think I'm a whore?"
"04","08","66","RYAN","No. No, of course not."
"04","08","66","TAYLOR","Good, 'cause I'm not. Unless, of course, you want me to be."
"04","08","66","RYAN","Is that my negligee? Mm-hmm. Well, I want that back."
"04","08","66","TAYLOR","Come on. Before I change my mind."
"04","08","66","RYAN","All right, but just to be clear..."
"04","08","66","TAYLOR","Everything but."
"04","08","66","RYAN","Come here."
"04","08","67","SETH","Staring at that bunny thinking of a baby, aren't you?"
"04","08","67","SUMMER","I'm sorry I abandoned you in the desert."
"04","08","67","SETH","I deserved it. And it worked out kind of well, too. I found something that I thought might interest you."
"04","08","67","SUMMER","Oh, my God."
"04","08","67","SETH","But I want to say something first. When I found out it was your pregnancy test, I totally freaked out and I thought ""This will change everything,"" but then Ryan asked me if I could imagine a time when I'd ever not want to be with you, and I realized that the answer is no."
"04","08","67","SUMMER","I'm totally pregnant, aren't I?"
"04","08","67","SETH","I don't know."
"04","08","67","SUMMER","What do you mean you don't know? Is that going to, like, squirt invisible ink or something?"
"04","08","67","SETH","No, but it will make you engaged to me."
"04","08","67","SUMMER","What? Are you insane?"
"04","08","67","SETH","Possibly, but I'm certain of this."
"04","08","67","SUMMER","No, Cohen, we can't. Sure, we can. We're both adults, we don't share DNA."
"04","08","67","SETH","You just have to want to. But... I do."
"04","08","67","SUMMER","Don't you think we should look at the test first?"
"04","08","67","SETH","And have you wonder for the rest of your life if I proposed to you because you're pregnant? I'm doing this because I love you, I want to spend the rest of my life with you."
"04","08","67","SUMMER","You know, once you do this, you can't take it back?"
"04","08","67","SETH","I know. Summer Roberts, will you marry me?"
"04","08","67","SUMMER","Yes, I'll marry you."
"04","08","67","SETH","All right."
"04","08","67","SUMMER","Okay, so should we look at the test now?"
"04","08","67","SETH","Sure. Let's see what's in store for the futureMr. and Mrs. Seth Cohen."
"04","08","67","SUMMER","How many bars is that?"
"04","08","67","SETH","One. What's that mean?"
"04","08","67","SUMMER","One means I'm not pregnant. I'm not pregnant. Is it inappropriate to celebrate?"
"04","08","67","SETH","No, please, please. Saves us from having to have a shotgun wedding. Now we can just have a normal one instead."
"04","08","67","SUMMER","Yeah. You and me and our normal wedding."
"04","08","67","SETH","Should we hug again?"
"04","08","68","FRANK","Have a seat."
"04","08","68","JULIE","I'm not trading s*x for silence, Frank. I may be a madam, but I'm not a whore."
"04","08","68","FRANK","Good to know, but that's not why I brought you here."
"04","08","68","JULIE","It's not?"
"04","08","68","FRANK","Sit down."
"04","08","68","JULIE","So, why did you bring me here?"
"04","08","68","FRANK","For information."
"04","08","68","JULIE","Information about what?"
"04","08","68","FRANK","About the Cohen family."
"04","08","68","JULIE","Why?"
"04","08","68","FRANK","Because I'm not who I say I am."
"04","08","68","JULIE","And who are you?"
"04","08","68","FRANK","I'm Ryan's father."
"04","09","0","TAYLOR","So I woke up early this morning to make my New Year's resolutions, but I think I need your help. So number one, stop mooching off other people's families, and get a job. Number two, start taking calcium supplements. Do you think that's enough?"
"04","09","0","SUMMER","Uh, how about number three? Plan Summer's wedding."
"04","09","0","TAYLOR","But engaged? Oh, my God. Why didn't you say something sooner?"
"04","09","0","SUMMER","Denial."
"04","09","0","TAYLOR","Hmm. How romantic."
"04","09","0","SUMMER","Look, someday I want to get married, and I'm guessing that it will be to Seth. But now that I'm without child..."
"04","09","0","TAYLOR","Well, have you told Seth that? 'Cause getting married is kind of a big deal. I should know."
"04","09","0","SUMMER","Well, Taylor, I cannot break it off. You should have seen his face when he asked me. He's never been that sincere in his entire life. Usually everything he says is laced with irony and contempt. But he meant it. So did I."
"04","09","0","TAYLOR","Except you didn't, not really. Summer, you have to tell him how you really feel. Okay, great. I've always wanted to plan a wedding. I'm thinking bagpipes. Maybe a replica of the Starship Enterprise."
"04","09","1","RYAN","Hey. Why are you still in bed? Are you sick or something?"
"04","09","1","SETH","I am sick, Ryan. I'm sick of being engaged."
"04","09","1","RYAN","So you asked her before you looked at the test?"
"04","09","1","SETH","I was trying to be a man, a plan with a fundamental conceptual flaw."
"04","09","1","RYAN","And now?"
"04","09","1","RYAN","Acting impulsively when your girlfriend is pregnant, believe me, I know about that. But you can't ask Summer to marry you if you don't want to get married."
"04","09","1","SETH","Well, I can't ask her and then take it back. You should have seen the look on her face; it'd crush her."
"04","09","1","RYAN","All right, that's cool, that's cool. Let's go call Sandy d Kirsten."
"04","09","1","SETH","No. No, no."
"04","09","1","RYAN","They might think you're too young, but I'm sure after we tell them about the whole pregnancy scare, they'll totally get behind it."
"04","09","1","SETH","Ow."
"04","09","2","RYAN","So just you know, Seth doesn't want to get married."
"04","09","2","TAYLOR","Well, it's not like Summer wants to be a desperate housewife."
"04","09","2","RYAN","Right."
"04","09","2","TAYLOR","Yeah, it's going to be easy then. All it will take is one of them to say they think theyshould wait a while, and the other will happily agree, and that'll be that. Except that it is Seth and Summer."
"04","09","2","RYAN","Right. Oh, here they come."
"04","09","2","SUMMER","Hey. So Seth and I had a long talk."
"04","09","2","SETH","Ryan, I'd like you to be my best man."
"04","09","2","SUMMER","And I'd like you to be my maid of honor."
"04","09","2","RYAN","Well, I'd be honored."
"04","09","2","TAYLOR","Yes, me, too. Super. Let's go talk wedding stuff."
"04","09","2","SETH","Okay. Uh... I feel good about this. I think a little long-term lifelong commitment is exactly what I needed."
"04","09","2","RYAN","This is bad."
"04","09","2","SETH","This is so bad."
"04","09","3","SANDY","Thanks for meeting me."
"04","09","3","FRANK","Thanks for calling."
"04","09","3","SANDY","So you're Ryan's father."
"04","09","3","FRANK","That's funny, 'cause I was just going to say the same thing to you."
"04","09","4","JULIE","House drip? I ordered a bone-dry cappuccino."
"04","09","4","KIRSTEN","This one's for u. I didn't know what to get Frank and everyone likes the house drip."
"04","09","4","JULIE","Frank?"
"04","09","4","KIRSTEN","Our new accountant. Did he go to Dubai with Bullet?"
"04","09","4","JULIE","Um, actually, Keeks, I was going to talk to you about that."
"04","09","5","FRANK","I know I've got a lot of explaining to do, Sandy."
"04","09","5","SANDY","Well, yeah, you can start with what you're doing in Newport, using a fake name, working for my wife."
"04","09","5","FRANK","I want to see Ryan."
"04","09","5","SANDY","So ring our doorbell, introduce yourself."
"04","09","5","FRANK","And have Ryan answer it? I don't think he'd be thrilled to see me."
"04","09","6","KIRSTEN","So how did Frank Atwood become our new accountant?"
"04","09","6","JULIE","He became friends with Bullet while they were both locked up, and Bullet offered him a job. Frank saw that he had holdings in Newport, saw your name on the New Match portfolio. He found out from Social Services that Ryan was living with you."
"04","09","7","SANDY","I got to be honest, Frank, knowing what I do about you, and your past, it's tough to root for that family reunion."
"04","09","7","FRANK","I only ask that you hear me out."
"04","09","8","KIRSTEN","Rehabilitated ?"
"04","09","8","JULIE","He used to hit Dawn and the boys."
"04","09","8","KIRSTEN","How rehabilitated could he be?"
"04","09","8","JULIE","Well, he owned up to all that, made no excuses. Apparently, the violence always started after he'd been drinking, and he hasn't had a drop in eight years. He went to anger management, got his GED, took some business classes by correspondence."
"04","09","9","SANDY","I know about that; I checked your record."
"04","09","9","FRANK","You ever think maybe the system works sometimes?"
"04","09","9","SANDY","Yeah. But how come you're reaching out to Ryan only now?"
"04","09","10","JULIE","He only got out six weeks ago. What was he supposedto do before that? Send a postcard from prison? ""Great food. Love the view. Wish you were here."" Look, his entire family hated him. He's the first to admit he deserved it."
"04","09","10","KIRSTEN","So you think he's really changed?"
"04","09","10","JULIE","Yeah, I guess I do."
"04","09","11","FRANK","I know it's on me to prove itto Ryan and to you, that I'm a different guy. But I'd like the shot. With your blessing, of course, and hopefully with your help."
"04","09","12","RYAN","Of course you had a chance to break it off, you just chickened out."
"04","09","12","SETH","Summer had the same chance."
"04","09","12","RYAN","Yeah, maybe she's a chicken, too."
"04","09","12","SETH","Summer Roberts is not a chicken. She wants to get married."
"04","09","12","RYAN","Yeah, you sure about that?"
"04","09","12","SETH","Why, did Taylor say that she doesn't?"
"04","09","12","RYAN","Will it hurt your feelings if I say yes?"
"04","09","12","SETH","No. Then yes."
"04","09","12","RYAN","She says someday."
"04","09","12","SETH","But not now. I said the exact same thing."
"04","09","12","RYAN","All right, well, then tell her you don't want to be engaged."
"04","09","12","SETH","She'll be fine with it. And spend the rest of my life living down the fact that I left her at the altar?"
"04","09","12","RYAN","The ring you gave her glows in the dark."
"04","09","12","SETH","I know; it's so cool."
"04","09","12","RYAN","Yes, and I think she'll get over it."
"04","09","12","SETH","Yeah, she says she'll get over it, but what she means is she'll get even, okay? Now, if she doesn't want to marry me, she can tell me that herself."
"04","09","12","RYAN","Hmm, good point."
"04","09","12","SETH","Really?"
"04","09","12","RYAN","No, but if you're too chicken to tell Summer how you feel, give her no choice but to tell you how she feels. Smoke her out."
"04","09","12","SETH","I'm not a chicken."
"04","09","13","KAITLIN","Thanks for the nap. I really needed to be put to sleep."
"04","09","13","KAITLIN","We're supposed to talk about the book like Buck would. And, well, Buck is a dog. So, I think that Buck would say... Ruff, ruff, ruff. Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff. Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff..."
"04","09","13","KAITLIN","But the assignment was 500 words."
"04","09","13","KAITLIN","Kind of. I mean, it was original at least."
"04","09","13","KAITLIN","Cool."
"04","09","13","KAITLIN","An extra year in high school is definitely not funny."
"04","09","14","RYAN","Hey. No shrimp tacos today; we got fish. You like tilapia?"
"04","09","14","SANDY","Oh, I love the tilapia, but I'm actually not hungry. Thanks, though."
"04","09","14","RYAN","What's up?"
"04","09","14","SANDY","Are you on a break anytime soon?"
"04","09","15","RYAN","You talked to him today?"
"04","09","15","SANDY","We met, yeah."
"04","09","15","RYAN","Always knew one day he'd be out."
"04","09","15","SANDY","Well, he's out."
"04","09","15","RYAN","Yeah, yeah. It's... weird. And I know I'm supposed to have a lot of questions, but... it's like my dad's from another life it's so far in the past."
"04","09","15","SANDY","Well, if that's how you want to keep it, that's fine with me."
"04","09","15","RYAN","No speech about the importance of family?"
"04","09","15","SANDY","You're my family. What's important to me is you."
"04","09","15","RYAN","I don't want to see him. Maybe later, not now."
"04","09","15","SANDY","Then that's what I'll tell him."
"04","09","15","RYAN","Yeah."
"04","09","15","SANDY","And no need to explain."
"04","09","15","RYAN","Thanks."
"04","09","15","SANDY","So I'll see you at home."
"04","09","15","RYAN","Uh-huh. Sandy, how'd he seem?"
"04","09","15","SANDY","He seemed good."
"04","09","15","RYAN","Good."
"04","09","16","SANDY","Frank, Sandy Cohen here."
"04","09","16","FRANK","Hey, Sandy."
"04","09","16","SANDY","Hi, listen, I spoke to Ryan, and, uh, I'm sorry, but he does not want to see you."
"04","09","16","FRANK","Not even a half hour for a cup of coffee?"
"04","09","16","SANDY","No. Not now. I'm sorry, Frank. Best of luck to you."
"04","09","16","FRANK","Yeah, um, thanks for trying."
"04","09","16","JULIE","Ryan said no? What are you gonna do?"
"04","09","17","SUMMER","A cookbook? I thought you got me a present."
"04","09","17","SETH","That's just the first part of it. I also signed you up for some cooking classes. Here you go."
"04","09","17","SUMMER","But... I don't even like cking."
"04","09","17","SUMMER","Since when? Your mother never cooked."
"04","09","17","SETH","Since I decided to get a wife of my own. I also brought over the Torah. You're converting to Judaism."
"04","09","18","SUMMER","He's totally trying to smoke me out. He wants me to break off thengagement so he can live a long, guilt-free life being a big, fat victim. It is sneaky, cowardly and passive-aggressive."
"04","09","18","TAYLOR","And you wish you'd thought of it first?"
"04","09","18","SUMMER","Totally."
"04","09","18","TAYLOR","So what are you gonna do, level with him and tell him the truth?"
"04","09","18","SUMMER","Crack that. He wants a game of chicken?He's gonna get it."
"04","09","18","SUMMER","I'm going bridezilla on his ass."
"04","09","19","SANDY","Hey, honey."
"04","09","19","KIRSTEN","Hey, Sandy."
"04","09","19","SANDY","I didn't know you were in a meeting. Are you okay? What happened?"
"04","09","19","KIRSTEN","We need to talk."
"04","09","19","SANDY","What are you doing here?"
"04","09","19","KIRSTEN","Frank's not leaving."
"04","09","19","SANDY","Well, I'm sorry, but I spoke to Ryan, and that's what he wants."
"04","09","19","FRANK","There's something I didn't tell you when we spoke. I was hoping I wouldn't need to mention it. But then I was saying good-bye to the ladies, and it just came out."
"04","09","19","JULIE","Sandy, Frank is dying."
"04","09","20","KIRSTEN","I felt terrible at dinner last night, not saying anything to Ryan."
"04","09","20","SANDY","Well, you shouldn't. Did he mention Frank? Did he seem remotely curious at all?"
"04","09","20","KIRSTEN","Well, he's Ryan. I'm sure he's full of questions. He's just sitting on them."
"04","09","20","SANDY","You know, I asked him point-blank, and he said he did not want to see him."
"04","09","20","KIRSTEN","He doesn't know he's sick."
"04","09","20","SANDY","If he's."
"04","09","20","KIRSTEN","You think Frank's lying about having cancer?"
"04","09","20","SANDY","Well, yeah, he's not the most trustworthy guy I've ever met."
"04","09","20","KIRSTEN","Yeah, he'd lie about that. He smoked two packs of cigarettes a day since he was 14 years old. It would be weird if he didn't have lung cancer. I appreciate you being cautious, but this seems personal."
"04","09","20","SANDY","It is personal. Ryan is our son. Because Frank turned his back on his family. He has hurt Ryan before. I'm not gonna let him do it again."
"04","09","20","KIRSTEN","But what if he's not lying? Please. What if Ryan finds out that we knew the truth and didn't tell him? Just let me talk to him, please."
"04","09","21","SUMMER","Shalom, Cohen. Well, since you brought me presents yesterday, I thought I'd return the favor."
"04","09","21","SETH","Oh, that is sweet."
"04","09","21","SETH","Ah, diamonds. Sure, sure. Well, if we're really doing this, we better do it right."
"04","09","21","SUMMER","Exactly. Which means nothing less than two carats."
"04","09","21","SETH","Why not three? You're worth it."
"04","09","21","SUMMER","Oh, there's just one more thing."
"04","09","21","SETH","Pancakes?"
"04","09","21","SUMMER","Pancakes. I thought he should live with you for a little while. You know, I just need to make sure my husband can take care of something small and vulnerable."
"04","09","21","SETH","Sure, sure, I've been meaning to spend a little one-on-one time with the little guy."
"04","09","21","SETH","Oh, and I've been thinking, uh, Yates or maybe Shelley."
"04","09","21","SUMMER","You're working on the guest list?"
"04","09","21","SETH","Those are poets, Summer, and their words will inspire my vows. Have you been working on yours?"
"04","09","21","SUMMER","Why, yes. I was thinking of Shel Silverstein with a dash of Dr. Seuss. ""I meant what I said, I said what I meant, an elephant's faithful a hundred percent."""
"04","09","21","SETH","Very moving, Summer."
"04","09","21","SUMMER","I know."
"04","09","21","SETH","Okay. We sort of had a dog once."
"04","09","22","KAITLIN","Hey, band geek. Sorry, I meant that band geek."
"04","09","22","KAITLIN","That's what she says. And you never disobey Miss Tidy?"
"04","09","22","KAITLIN","Actually, I was wondering if you could just write something down and give it to me tomorrow."
"04","09","22","KAITLIN","Look, little drummer boy, Miss Tidy said that you had to help me with my assignment. If I fail, you fail."
"04","09","22","KAITLIN","Stupid has nothing to do with it. See you before class."
"04","09","23","SANDY","I didn't know you were coming by."
"04","09","23","KIRSTEN","Oh, well, I knew you'd be at court all morning, and doing all that good can work up quite an appetite."
"04","09","23","SANDY","You're telling me."
"04","09","23","KIRSTEN","Roast beef is rare, and the mustard is spicy."
"04","09","23","SANDY","Then I'm a happy man, but I'm guessing a picnic isn't the only reason you stopped by."
"04","09","23","KIRSTEN","Aw, Sandy, I don't want to fight with you."
"04","09","23","SANDY","We both love Ryan and we both want what's best for him."
"04","09","23","KIRSTEN","Sometimes we're just not gonna see eye to eye."
"04","09","23","SANDY","No, and our yin-yang style of parenting has produced two pretty good kids, so why stop now?"
"04","09","23","KIRSTEN","Does that mean everything is okay?"
"04","09","23","SANDY","I know you want to talk to Ryan. I respect that. But you should know I called Dr. Alessi at the prison. I asked him to look into Frank Atwood's medical records."
"04","09","23","KIRSTEN","Sandy, that's an invasion of privacy."
"04","09","23","SANDY","Yin and yang, baby. If I'm wrong, I'll eat my words, but if I'm right, the sooner we know, the better."
"04","09","23","KIRSTEN","Does that mean I'm the yang?"
"04","09","23","SANDY","Maybe."
"04","09","24","RYAN","See you tomorrow. Hi."
"04","09","24","TAYLOR","Hey. What do you want to do? Maybe get some Mexican food?"
"04","09","24","RYAN","That is the last thing I want to do ever again."
"04","09","24","TAYLOR","Occupational hazard."
"04","09","24","RYAN","Uh-huh, uh-huh. Actually, I have to stop by Kirsten's office. She said she wanted to talk to me."
"04","09","24","TAYLOR","Do you think it's about your father?"
"04","09","24","RYAN","Uh, well, I hope not. I made it very clear I don't want to see him."
"04","09","24","TAYLOR","Right. Which I totally support."
"04","09","24","RYAN","Mmm, you just don't agree."
"04","09","24","TAYLOR","Well, it's none of my business."
"04","09","24","RYAN","Ah, that's never stopped you before."
"04","09","24","TAYLOR","Look, all I know is that if my father wanted to see me, even if he was a lying, violent, drunken card shark who holds up liquor stores with a sawed-off shotgun..."
"04","09","24","RYAN","My mother's a card shark, but whatever."
"04","09","24","TAYLOR","I would still want to see him. If only to get whatever feelings I had off my chest to tell him that I think he's a total ass and I never want to see him again."
"04","09","24","RYAN","That would feel good."
"04","09","24","TAYLOR","Ryan, my dad lives in San Diego with his new family. He comes to Newport once a quarter to check on his car dealership and play around at Big Canyon I haven't even spent more than 20 minutes with him since I was in second grade. It's just... really easy to ignore your kids, and the hard part is trying to have a relationship."
"04","09","24","RYAN","Look, I'm sure everything you're saying is right, but you don't know my father."
"04","09","24","TAYLOR","You haven't seen him since you were a little kid. No offense, but you don't really know him either."
"04","09","25","JULIE","It says Dalet."
"04","09","25","SUMMER","Damn it. Oh, my brisket is burning. Ooh!"
"04","09","25","JULIE","I like it chewy."
"04","09","25","SUMMER","Julie, I really appreciate you helping me and filling in for Rabbi Gutterman, but this just is not working."
"04","09","25","JULIE","Right, and whenever you want to let me know what this is, I'm all ears. As much as I've enjoyed learning the Hebrew alphabet with you."
"04","09","25","SUMMER","Well, this is a ridiculous sham. I mean, not that I don't look forward to one day becoming Jewish."
"04","09","25","JULIE","Did Seth dare you to do this?"
"04","09","25","SUMMER","Um, in a way, yes. We're engaged."
"04","09","25","JULIE","Oh, that's great! I think. You're young, but, hey, worked for me."
"04","09","25","SUMMER","You can't tell anyone."
"04","09","25","JULIE","No, no, but Summer, did... Are you...?"
"04","09","25","SUMMER","No, no... we thought that I might be."
"04","09","25","JULIE","Then why are you getting married?"
"04","09","25","SUMMER","Because he asked me, and I said yes."
"04","09","25","JULIE","And now you don't want to call it off because you don't want to hurt his feelings."
"04","09","25","SUMMER","Mmm."
"04","09","25","JULIE","Or 'cause if you do, he'll get the upper hand."
"04","09","25","SUMMER","Exactly."
"04","09","25","JULIE","Now we're talking my kind of dating game."
"04","09","25","SUMMER","Manipulating the opposite s*x. God, Julie, why didn't I come to you earlier?"
"04","09","25","JULIE","Thank you, Summer. Look, if you want to take him down, you have to kick it up a notch. It's called chutzpah."
"04","09","25","SUMMER","I think it's chutz... chutzpah. Chutzpah. Okay, never mind. What are you thinking?"
"04","09","26","SANDY","After I talked to Sandy, I didn't think I'd hear from you again."
"04","09","26","KIRSTEN","I'm sorry he was so abrupt with you."
"04","09","26","SANDY","Can't say I blame him."
"04","09","26","KIRSTEN","He's really protective of Ryan. But we talked. Ok, well, there's someone here who wants to meet you."
"04","09","26","RYAN","Hi. Want to grab some coffee?"
"04","09","27","RYAN","It was fine."
"04","09","27","SETH","You haven't seen your father in eight years, and it was fine?"
"04","09","27","RYAN","Yeah, well, fine is not a total disaer. I'll take fine."
"04","09","27","SETH","What'd you guys talk about? Politics, movies?"
"04","09","27","RYAN","His Netflix queue must have been jam-packed."
"04","09","27","SETH","Has he seen Titanic?"
"04","09","27","RYAN","I don't kown. We just kind of talked. I mean, I don't know. I must have thought hundreds of times about what I would say to my dad when I saw him again, but... sitting in the diner, I just didn't want to say any of those things."
"04","09","27","SETH","Oh, because he's sick?"
"04","09","27","RYAN","Because he's normal. Look, you can meet him tonight. See for yourself. He's coming over for dinner."
"04","09","27","SETH","I would, but Summer and I have a date to build our chuppah together, but maybe if we get done early."
"04","09","27","RYAN","You know, you can stop that crazy train anytime you want."
"04","09","27","SETH","Yeah, I love her enough to ask her to marry me. I am not gonna lose her."
"04","09","27","RYAN","Uh, you mean you don't want to lose to< her."
"04","09","27","SETH","Exactly. Plus, the little guy is kind of starting to grow on me. Ain't that right, Pancakes? Oh, hi! Hi!"
"04","09","27","RYAN","Dude, you can't bring an animal in here. What are you doing?"
"04","09","27","SETH","How dare you talk to your nephew that way. Don't listen to mean Uncle Ryan, Pancakes. That's just the 'roids talking. They do make him huge, I know."
"04","09","27","RYAN","Would you get him out of here, please, before he ends up in a quesadilla?"
"04","09","27","SETH","Ah. We'll be on the patio. Please bring us another side of carrots."
"04","09","28","KAITLIN","You got my speech?"
"04","09","29","KAITLIN","I'm sorry, guys. You've been replaced."
"04","09","29","KAITLIN","Yes, Ms. Tidy."
"04","09","29","KAITLIN","Oh, I worked really hard."
"04","09","29","KAITLIN","Ms. Tidy, there's been some kind of a mix-up. And Will here, he..."
"04","09","29","KAITLIN","Um... Buck is, like, this spoiled and pampered dog who lives a sweet life in a big house in California. And also, he's got really pretty hair. Then, one day, like the book says, the facts of life take a fiercer aspect, and then things just kind of start to suck. Buck goes through so much crap that he goes to live with some wolves, and he'd rather kill for his own food than talk to other people. I mean, not talk to other people, because he's a dog, and he doesn't... You guys know that. I think that... that Buck's story is kind of like a metaphor. A taphor for being a teenager. Just like... the more crap you go through, the more you kind of want to be alone."
"04","09","30","TAYLOR","Fish? Are you sure about that?"
"04","09","30","KIRSTEN","What's wrong with fish, Taylor? Everyone likes fish."
"04","09","30","TAYLOR","Well, what if Ryan's dad was a fisherman on choppy seas, and the smell of fish brings back bad memories?"
"04","09","30","KIRSTEN","Chino is inland, and Frank was a mechanic-- cars, not boats."
"04","09","30","TAYLOR","Oh. Okay, then. Wait. What is the FDA's official position on the spinach recall?"
"04","09","30","KIRSTEN","Spinach has a clean bill of health."
"04","09","30","TAYLOR","I don't think we should take any chances. I'm gonna go to the store and get some broccoli."
"04","09","30","KIRSTEN","Taylor... what's wrong? Even for you, you're acting a little strange."
"04","09","30","TAYLOR","Yeah, I know. I'm just really nervous. I'm meeting Ryan's dad. The guy hasn't seen a woman in eight years."
"04","09","30","KIRSTEN","I think he'll like you."
"04","09","30","TAYLOR","Well, it's not about that. I mean, of course he's gonna like me. It's just, my first real Ryan situation. Everything else has been all French husbands and slutty aliens."
"04","09","30","KIRSTEN","Excuse me?"
"04","09","30","TAYLOR","It's like the first major test of our relationship, and I just... I really want him to see that I can be there for the serious stuff, too."
"04","09","30","KIRSTEN","The fact that you're there for him means everything."
"04","09","30","TAYLOR","Ooh. Thanks, Keeks. You could make such a great mother-in-law."
"04","09","30","SANDY","What's going on here? We having some kind of feast?"
"04","09","30","TAYLOR","Frank's been eating prison food for almost a decade. The least we can do is grill him some fish. If he likes fish. Do you think he's gonna like fish?"
"04","09","30","SANDY","You invited Frank to dinner?"
"04","09","30","KIRSTEN","No, Ryan did."
"04","09","31","KIRSTEN","Hmm. Sandy, I told you that I was gonna talk to him. He just wants to see his father."
"04","09","31","SANDY","Well, now we all get to see him at the delightful extended family dinner."
"04","09","31","KIRSTEN","Have you heard back from the doctor at the prison?"
"04","09","31","SANDY","No. Not yet."
"04","09","31","KIRSTEN","Well, I guess we just make the best of it. We always do."
"04","09","31","SANDY","With Dawn, with Trey-- I think we've been very open with Ryan's family."
"04","09","31","KIRSTEN","Until now?"
"04","09","31","SANDY","Ryan's been through hell this year. And there is just something about this guy..."
"04","09","31","KIRSTEN","That he's not a total screwup ? Look, I get it. We all imagined that Ryan's father would be some kind of monster. And then he shows up, and he's smart, and he's funny, and he's nice."
"04","09","31","SANDY","Yeah, minus his record for spousal abuse and armed robbery, the guy's a real prize. Move over, Bachelor Bob."
"04","09","31","KIRSTEN","Sandy, your relationsh with Ryan is your relationship. Nothing's gonna change that."
"04","09","31","SANDY","Well, I know that. And I know this is important to Ryan."
"04","09","31","KIRSTEN","So important."
"04","09","31","SANDY","All right. Let me change. I'll fire up the grill. I'll put a smile on my face and conjure up some embarrassing stories about the family."
"04","09","31","KIRSTEN","Thank you."
"04","09","32","FRANK","Hey."
"04","09","32","JULIE","Hi. Is everything okay? When you called, you made it sounded like an emergency."
"04","09","32","FRANK","It sort of is. Jacket or no jacket?"
"04","09","32","JULIE","Whatever makes you feel comfortable."
"04","09","32","FRANK","In case you can't tell, I really want this to go well."
"04","09","32","JULIE","Just relax, be yourself, everyone will love you."
"04","09","32","FRANK","Thanks. Sound pretty sure about that."
"04","09","32","JULIE","Well, we've all done things we're not proud of, Frank, but people change. Ryan knows that, so do the Cohens."
"04","09","32","FRANK","No, I know, it's just..."
"04","09","32","JULIE","Hey, you'll be fine, Frank. It will all be fine."
"04","09","32","FRANK","Right. But maybe I'll bring the jacket, you know, just in case."
"04","09","32","JULIE","Good luck. Call me. Let me know how it goes."
"04","09","32","FRANK","Yeah. Julie... Thank you."
"04","09","33","SUMMER","Cohen. Pancakes."
"04","09","33","SETH","Hey, you ready for some chuppah construction, or you just want to take it easy and maybe brainstorm some ideas for the centerpiece?"
"04","09","33","SUMMER","Actually, I've changed my mind."
"04","09","33","SETH","You have?"
"04","09","33","SUMMER","Yes. I don't want some big, formal wedding extraganza. I want something smaller."
"04","09","33","SETH","Great, great. It'll just be our families, really intimate, be cozy."
"04","09","33","SUMMER","Even smaller. Me, you and Elvis! Let's elope, Vegas-style."
"04","09","33","SETH","Oh, wow, okay, well, yeah, you know. Planning a wedding can be such a pain in the ass. So we'll just have to pick a time that works for you and I..."
"04","09","33","SUMMER","How about now?"
"04","09","33","SETH","Now works, too. Let me just see if I can get a flight. You know, they may be all booked up."
"04","09","33","SUMMER","Well, hey, let's gas up the car and drive there."
"04","09","33","SETH","Awesome, a road trip, I love them."
"04","09","33","SUMMER","Well, hey, if you don't want to... No, of course I want to go."
"04","09","33","SETH","I really want to go. I just think I need to stop at home first to, um, change my underpants, 'cause you know how I feel about underpants."
"04","09","33","SUMMER","Well, come on. It's our honeymoon. Go commando!"
"04","09","33","SETH","Awesome."
"04","09","33","SUMMER","Come on, no stops, no excuses. I am marrying you tonight."
"04","09","33","SETH","Not if I marry you first."
"04","09","34","RYAN","Yeah, so I guess the plan is that I'd start there in the fall."
"04","09","34","FRANK","Well, Berkeley's a great school. Or, you know,so I hear. How'd you pick it?"
"04","09","34","SANDY","Kirsten and I went there."
"04","09","34","KIRSTEN","We met there, so it's a very special place for us."
"04","09","34","FRANK","Well, that's-that's great. Family tradition. Ryan, do you remember the time we went to San Francisco?"
"04","09","34","RYAN","Uh, no."
"04","09","34","FRANK","That's 'cause we never quite made it. Your mom and I had this idea in our heads that we should take a family trip. So we all piled into that old pickup truck we had and drove up north for the weekend. But it was just miserable. Trey got carsick. We got two flat tires. Of course, we only had one spare. Day in the life of the Atwoods."
"04","09","34","FRANK","You know what? I actually have a photo from that trip."
"04","09","34","RYAN","Oh, there's no reason..."
"04","09","34","TAYLOR","Baby pictures, yay! Oh, my G, look at baby Ryan. You could already see that strong jawline, those piercing blue eyes that just stare right into your soul."
"04","09","34","RYAN","That's my cue to get dessert."
"04","09","34","SANDY","Kirsten makes a great key lime pie."
"04","09","34","TAYLOR","Only if you like key lime, though, because I actually thought lemon meringue. And if you want I can just go inside and whip it right up or... Peach tort, I make peach..."
"04","09","34","FRANK","You know, key lime sounds great."
"04","09","34","TAYLOR","You were right."
"04","09","34","KIRSTEN","I should clear the table."
"04","09","34","FRANK","Well, let me give you a hand."
"04","09","34","SANDY","No, no, sit down, sit down. You slaved in the kitchen all day, and you are our guest. So please, just relax."
"04","09","34","FRANK","Thank you."
"04","09","35","RYAN","So we all survived dinner."
"04","09","35","SANDY","Yeah. I got to say I didn't start off a big fan of your father's."
"04","09","35","RYAN","Join the club."
"04","09","35","SANDY","But he's kind of winning me over."
"04","09","35","RYAN","Yeah, huh? He's different than I remember him."
"04","09","35","SANDY","Well... people can change."
"04","09","35","RYAN","Too bad all it took was a terminal illness."
"04","09","35","SANDY","But better late then never, I guess."
"04","09","35","RYAN","True."
"04","09","35","SANDY","Looks good. Yeah. Will you excuse me for a second, I got to take this. Yeah, sure, I'll just take this outside."
"04","09","36","SANDY","Hello.Yeah, this is Sandy. Thanks for getting back to me, Dr. Alessi. I really appreciate you doing this for me, and I understand the position it puts you in. Uh-huh. I see. Well... Okay. Thank you."
"04","09","37","SETH","Are you okay? You want to stop?"
"04","09","37","SUMMER","No, I'm good."
"04","09","37","SETH","Are you hungry? Are you thirsty?"
"04","09","37","SUMMER","Sated and quenched, thanks."
"04","09","37","SETH","I can't do this."
"04","09","37","SUMMER","You can't?"
"04","09","37","SETH","No, I can't. Because, you know, as much as I love you..."
"04","09","37","SUMMER","Yeah?"
"04","09","37","SETH","It just doesn't feel right getting married. You know, without asking your father... for your hand."
"04","09","37","SUMMER","You want to ask, um, my dad's permission to marry me?"
"04","09","37","SETH","I do. Yes, I do."
"04","09","37","SUMMER","Cohen, that is such a holdover to when women were chattel, Traded between men like they were property and animals. Okay, I took two-thirds of a semester of women's studies and..."
"04","09","37","SETH","Well, I just, I can't do this to your father, Summer. We've watched too much golf together. I love that man."
"04","09","37","SUMMER","Okay... you know, once we ask my dad, there's no turning back."
"04","09","37","SETH","Oh, yeah, I know."
"04","09","37","SUMMER","Okay. Hey, well, let's head on home and make it official."
"04","09","37","SETH","Okay."
"04","09","38","FRANK","All I know is you're a ballplayer and then I go away and suddenly, you're in musicals?"
"04","09","38","RYAN","Mom had her dreams."
"04","09","38","TAYLOR","Don't you worry, Mr. Atwood, I'll straighten him out."
"04","09","38","FRANK","Hey, you know what? I like this girl, Ryan."
"04","09","38","TAYLOR","I told you he'd like me."
"04","09","38","KIRSTEN","I should make some coffee."
"04","09","38","SANDY","Sorry, I had a call."
"04","09","38","KIRSTEN","Decaf, hon?"
"04","09","38","SANDY","No, I'm good. Frank."
"04","09","38","FRANK","Hmm?"
"04","09","38","SANDY","Can I speak to you for a minute?"
"04","09","38","FRANK","Yeah, sure, excuse me."
"04","09","39","FRANK","Hey, Sandy, thanks again for everything. I mean, this has been a great evening, great dinner."
"04","09","39","SANDY","Yeah, well, when a man doesn't have a lot of time left, every meal counts."
"04","09","39","FRANK","Yeah, right."
"04","09","39","SANDY","Why are you doing this, Frank?"
"04","09","39","FRANK","What are you talking about?"
"04","09","39","SANDY","You're his father. He would have wanted to see you either way, and now he's going to find out you lied to him. I made some phone calls. You're as healthy as a horse."
"04","09","39","FRANK","You, uh... you checked up on my story?"
"04","09","39","SANDY","Yeah, for good reason. Your story doesn't check out. The cab is on its way. Now before you go, tell Ryan the truth. Or I will."
"04","09","39","FRANK","Look, you're wrong about him wanting to see me. He didn't. You know, he... Even though I came here clean and I-I-I was sorry, he still didn't want to see me."
"04","09","39","SANDY","Are you going to tell Ryan, or am I?"
"04","09","39","KIRSTEN","Is everything okay?"
"04","09","39","SANDY","Frank? Frank, you got something you want to say?"
"04","09","39","FRANK","Nope, nothing."
"04","09","39","RYAN","What's the matter?"
"04","09","39","SANDY","Then I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
"04","09","39","FRANK","I'm not going anywhere."
"04","09","39","SANDY","This is my house."
"04","09","39","FRANK","And he's my son."
"04","09","39","SANDY","Not anymore. I've extended you every courtesy. Now, I'm going to have to show you the door."
"04","09","39","FRANK","Hey, don't touch me."
"04","09","39","SANDY","Oh, come on. Let's go."
"04","09","39","FRANK","Or what? You don't want to hit me."
"04","09","39","SANDY","Oh, yes, I do."
"04","09","39","FRANK","That was a mistake, Sandy."
"04","09","39","SANDY","I'm standing right here, Frank."
"04","09","39","RYAN","Hey, hey, hey, stop. Stop! What the hell is going on?"
"04","09","39","SANDY","Ryan, your father wants to tell you something."
"04","09","39","RYAN","All right, come on. Let's talk outside."
"04","09","39","KIRSTEN","Sandy, what on earth?"
"04","09","39","SANDY","Well, the good news is, Frank Atwood is going to outlive us all. The bad news? My hand is killing me."
"04","09","39","TAYLOR","I'll get you some ice."
"04","09","39","SANDY","Thank you."
"04","09","40","KAITLIN","That was pretty good."
"04","09","40","KAITLIN","I don't watch girls' basketball. Chicks with big hands freak me out."
"04","09","40","KAITLIN","Maybe you're not a total geek after all. I mean, you're still a geek, but you got me pretty good. I've got to respect that."
"04","09","40","KAITLIN","It's not like I care if you respect me or not. But thanks."
"04","09","40","KAITLIN","No. What else would I say?"
"04","09","40","KAITLIN","So are you."
"04","09","40","KAITLIN","Something with you? I don't think so. Good, 'cause, 'cause I didn't want to do nothing anyway."
"04","09","40","KAITLIN","Really, because that's what you do? Just ask people what they're doing?"
"04","09","40","KAITLIN","Well, then why don't you ask this guy what he's doing?"
"04","09","40","KAITLIN","Hey, guy, do you want to do something with him? Because he's..."
"04","09","40","KAITLIN","What? Sorry."
"04","09","41","FRANK","Ryan, it was one lie."
"04","09","41","RYAN","Kind of a big one."
"04","09","41","FRANK","I needed to buy some time. I just wanted you to get to know me better, so that, you know, maybe you could forgive me. Of all the bad things I've done, this doesn't even make the top ten."
"04","09","41","RYAN","Yeah. That's a hell of a point."
"04","09","41","FRANK","Look, I want to do better. Will you help me?"
"04","09","41","RYAN","I think you should just go."
"04","09","41","FRANK","Ryan!"
"04","09","41","RYAN","It's too soon."
"04","09","41","FRANK","I've worked so hard to get..."
"04","09","41","RYAN","Not for you, for me."
"04","09","41","FRANK","Oh. Yeah. Okay. Sorry, not much of a hugger."
"04","09","41","RYAN","Yeah, I know."
"04","09","41","FRANK","Look, I'm sorry about what happened in there. All right, see you."
"04","09","41","RYAN","I'll call you."
"04","09","42","TAYLOR","Did your dad leave?"
"04","09","42","RYAN","When you get decked after dessert, it's usually a time to call it a night."
"04","09","42","TAYLOR","Good tip. So are you okay?"
"04","09","42","RYAN","First dinner with the family."
"04","09","42","TAYLOR","Very impressive."
"04","09","42","RYAN","I'm sorry you had to go through that."
"04","09","42","TAYLOR","Are you kidding? It was amazing. Well, not amazing, but, you know intense. And we went through it together, so it was kind of like our first major relationship milestone."
"04","09","42","RYAN","Yeah, I guess it was."
"04","09","42","TAYLOR","And now you are totally prepared for dinner with my mom."
"04","09","42","RYAN","Huh. Well, no family is perfect, right?"
"04","09","42","TAYLOR","Mmm. Yours is pretty close. You should go spend time with them. I'll call you tomorrow."
"04","09","43","RYAN","You all right?"
"04","09","43","RYAN","He kind of asked for it."
"04","09","43","SANDY","And I'm sorry things didn't work out with your dad."
"04","09","43","RYAN","My dad is right here. But you know, if you want, I can teach you a mean left hook, just in case. Just in case what?"
"04","09","43","SANDY","You got more relatives showing up here or what?"
"04","09","43","RYAN","I have some mean uncles."
"04","09","43","SANDY","I bet you do."
"04","09","44","JULIE","Well, you get caught lying about cancer, you're going to get punched, those are the rules."
"04","09","44","FRANK","Yeah, I just wanted time with the kid. I don't think I would have said or done anything."
"04","09","44","JULIE","I understand, believe me."
"04","09","44","FRANK","No matter what lie I told, I would have got caught eventually."
"04","09","44","JULIE","God knows Sandy's caught me in more than a few whoppers. He's just looking out for Ryan."
"04","09","44","FRANK","If I'd done a little more of that in my day, I wouldn't be in this position in the first place."
"04","09","44","JULIE","So where you going to go now?"
"04","09","44","FRANK","Bullet's got opportunities all over. I'll think of something. As for you, this ought to keep things straight with Gordon. I think you'll find these books are cooked, so you can hide as much as you make."
"04","09","44","JULIE","Oh, the prostitution ring. No. After you busted me on New Year's, I made a resolution to quit. It's hard out there for a pimp."
"04","09","44","FRANK","It's a nice little operation. I mean in no time, you could pay for that house you live in. Be financially independent. Here, you think about it. Okay. I, uh, I want to thank you for everything, Julie."
"04","09","44","JULIE","See you. Uh, keep in touch."
"04","09","45","SETH","Hi, everybody."
"04","09","45","SANDY","Look at you. Where were you?"
"04","09","45","SETH","Uh, I was working late. Sorry I missed dinner."
"04","09","45","RYAN","That's all right. I noticed you're not nursing a bunny."
"04","09","45","SETH","I noticed that, too. Yes, Pancakes is with his mother since I'm going to be heading up to Seattle to visit Dr. Roberts."
"04","09","45","KIRSTEN","Oh, that's odd."
"04","09","45","SETH","Speaking of fathers, where's Ryan's?"
"04","09","45","KIRSTEN","Sandy punched him."
"04","09","45","SETH","You punched a dying man?"
"04","09","45","SANDY","Well, it turns out he wasn't dying."
"04","09","45","RYAN","That's why he punched him."
"04","09","45","SETH","Miss one dinner around here..."
"04","09","45","KIRSTEN","Well, you're home now. Get on the couch. It's family time."
"04","09","45","SETH","Is it family time?"
"04","09","45","SANDY","Come on. Sit thee down."
"04","09","45","SETH","All right, what are we watching?"
"04","09","45","SANDY","Well, it's about meerkats. Meerkats."
"04","09","45","SETH","Why are we watching it?"
"04","09","45","KIRSTEN","Because I wanted to."
"04","09","45","SANDY","And we don't want to get your mother angry. You haven't seen her right cross."
"04","09","45","RYAN","Dad's pretty good though."
"04","09","45","SETH","That makes sense. He was in a gang."
"04","10","0","TAYLOR","It is.It's too much."
"04","10","0","RYAN","No,no,no,no.Not... What is it?"
"04","10","0","TAYLOR","New bookstore opened. It looks like a good bookstore."
"04","10","0","RYAN","All right,well,look,I should get back to work."
"04","10","0","TAYLOR","Oh,yeah,okay."
"04","10","0","RYAN","But thank you.This was really great."
"04","10","0","TAYLOR","Good,I'm glad you liked it.Bye. I'll call you later."
"04","10","0","RYAN","Ok."
"04","10","1","TAYLOR","a season for peaches - henri-micheal de momourant. Oh,no.No,this cannot be happening. Excuse me,uh... what is this book?"
"04","10","1","TAYLOR","Okay,what's it about?"
"04","10","1","TAYLOR","Oh,my God.Plot,please."
"04","10","1","TAYLOR","His family's chapel in Burgundy."
"04","10","1","TAYLOR","No. I lived it. I'm Peaches."
"04","10","2","RYAN","Here you go."
"04","10","2","SETH","Oh,trusty neck pillow. What did Ryan do to you?"
"04","10","2","RYAN","So you're really going to Seattle?"
"04","10","2","SETH","You don't want to marry a girl,you've got to ask her father's permission,Ryan. It's the polite thing to do."
"04","10","2","RYAN","Yeah,except you don't want to get married,which you could still tell her,you know."
"04","10","2","SETH","Not a chance."
"04","10","2","RYAN","So you guys are really gonna walk down the aisle because neither of you is willing to back down."
"04","10","2","SETH","This is where Dr.Roberts comes in. He rejects me,this whole game of chicken ends and I don't have to be the bad guy."
"04","10","2","RYAN","But are you positive that he's gonna say ""no""? I mean,I thought you guys bonded before he left."
"04","10","2","SETH","There was some golf watching. There may have even been some sandwich eating. But deep down inside,he still sees me as the skinny 16-year-old boy trying to seduce his daughter. I just need to remind him of that."
"04","10","2","RYAN","Brilliant plan.Good luck getting rejected."
"04","10","2","SETH","Fortunately,it's something I excel at. Taylor."
"04","10","2","TAYLOR","Ryan,can I talk to you for just a second?"
"04","10","2","RYAN","Yeah,sure. Is anything wrong?"
"04","10","2","TAYLOR","Oh,no. Well,nothing big. A teensy little thing. So Michiko Kakatani called it ""a sexual epic,"" which I think is a real stretch. It's already been banned in Texas,so we don't have to worry about people there reading it. I debated even telling you about this,but you know my policy- full disclosure."
"04","10","3","TAYLOR","So,how are you? Okay?"
"04","10","3","RYAN","Your ex-husband wrote this about you."
"04","10","3","TAYLOR","A novel,not a memoir. It's a big difference.Ask James Frey. It's just that things between us have been so good lately, and I wouldn't want one silly,erotic novel to change all that. So I'm gonna ask you a favor. Please don't read it."
"04","10","3","RYAN","Look,I've never read a romance novel before."
"04","10","3","TAYLOR","Shocker."
"04","10","3","RYAN","And I'm not gonna start now."
"04","10","3","TAYLOR","Thank you. I'm gonna put this away now and we will never have to talk about it again."
"04","10","3","RYAN","Until the movie comes out."
"04","10","3","TAYLOR","Yeah,right. Like they could make a movie about that. Maybe on DVD at the adult video store."
"04","10","4","JULIE","What are the numbers on this guy?"
"04","10","4","JULIE","Nope.No good. You know Mrs.Jacobson,she likes her boys straight out of Muscle Beach. Okay,these two should do. Tell her she can have either at $2,500,gratuity not included. And here comes Kirsten.Go on,get out of here right now,thank you. Hi,Kiki."
"04","10","4","KIRSTEN","Hello,Spencer. How's your dad?"
"04","10","4","KIRSTEN","What's he doing here?"
"04","10","4","JULIE","Oh,he was just helping me move some furniture."
"04","10","4","KIRSTEN","Everything looks the same."
"04","10","4","JULIE","Yeah,it looked terrible,so I had him move it back."
"04","10","4","KIRSTEN","Would you like me to help you return those calls?"
"04","10","4","JULIE","I got it. Ooh,better get this. Work,work,work. Oh,and thanks for the coffee."
"04","10","5","TAYLOR","Hello !"
"04","10","5","SUMMER","Hey. What do you think of updos?"
"04","10","5","TAYLOR","Are you reading Modern Bride?"
"04","10","5","SUMMER","As we speak,Seth is on his way to Seattle to ask my dad if he can marry me."
"04","10","5","TAYLOR","So,here comes the bride,I guess. Summer,do you realize what you're doing? You're about to enter into a doomed marriage."
"04","10","5","SUMMER","I don't know,Seth seems really committed. Look,I think I might marry him someday,so maybe there's no point in waiting."
"04","10","5","TAYLOR","So,living with me and the story of my divorce has taught you nothing."
"04","10","5","SUMMER","No offense,Taylor,but you married some French dude you knew for,like,nine seconds. This is a little different."
"04","10","5","TAYLOR","Okay,I see I need to get more into your wheel house if I'm gonna drive this home. What about Holly?"
"04","10","5","SUMMER","From high school?"
"04","10","5","TAYLOR","Yes,she got married last summer.Why don't you call her? She could give you a preview of life as a wife."
"04","10","5","SUMMER","Fine.Can we drop it?"
"04","10","5","TAYLOR","Fine."
"04","10","5","SUMMER","A Season For Peaches. You know,I'm reading this.This is dirty."
"04","10","5","TAYLOR","Excuse me,the girl just has a healthy s*x drive."
"04","10","5","SUMMER","Yeah,for a hooker."
"04","10","5","TAYLOR","Would you just give me that? Thank you. She's just young and confused,okay?!"
"04","10","6","RYAN","Can I get you anything else?"
"04","10","6","RYAN","It's not a library,you know."
"04","10","6","SANDY","Hey,Ryan. How are you today? Let's see what am I going to have."
"04","10","6","RYAN","Two shrimp tacos,Luis."
"04","10","6","SANDY","Luis,how are you today? I tell you,ever since you started working here,it's revolutionized my lunch hour. Kirsten's reading that. Let me tell you,there is one part..."
"04","10","6","RYAN","Page 47. Man,was that hot."
"04","10","6","SANDY","And in public. I thought Peaches was going to get arrested."
"04","10","6","RYAN","It's Taylor."
"04","10","6","SANDY","Who's Taylor?"
"04","10","6","RYAN","Her,the book,Peaches."
"04","10","6","SANDY","No,what are you talking about? It's about a girl from California who..."
"04","10","6","RYAN","Yeah."
"04","10","6","SANDY","So,uh... have you read it?"
"04","10","6","RYAN","No,and I'm not about to start.Can I get you anything else?"
"04","10","6","SANDY","No.No,I'm good. Maybe a glass of water."
"04","10","6","RYAN","Great."
"04","10","7","KAITLIN","I just don't see how they fit in the voting boxes."
"04","10","7","KAITLIN","Maybe they should've sacrificed some cheeseburgers. I'm kidding. Just ask me some questions."
"04","10","7","KAITLIN","The first women's rights convention."
"04","10","7","KAITLIN","Elizabeth Cady Stanton read the Declaration of Sentiments, which proclaimed that men and women were created equal."
"04","10","7","KAITLIN","I'm gonna rock that test That's thanks to you for helping me study."
"04","10","7","KAITLIN","Wait. What are you doing tomorrow night?"
"04","10","7","KAITLIN","Are you saying yes?"
"04","10","7","KAITLIN","Okay. You're cordially invited to hang out at my house. With me."
"04","10","7","KAITLIN","You shut up before I vomit on you."
"04","10","8","SUMMER","I'm so sorry I missed your wedding."
"04","10","8","SUMMER","Yeah. You know,Holly,when you were engaged,were you totally sure that you wanted to get married?"
"04","10","8","SUMMER","So there's,like,a whole crew of you guys?"
"04","10","8","SUMMER","Yeah. You know,it'd be nice to have a bunch of friends again."
"04","10","8","SUMMER","No."
"04","10","8","SUMMER","No."
"04","10","9","RYAN","Bad idea."
"04","10","9","RYAN","I'm sorry,what?"
"04","10","9","RYAN","Taylor."
"04","10","10","TAYLOR","Ryan,you in there? You know,I called you at work last night and,um,then at home,but I guess you must have been really tired. Oh,no..."
"04","10","10","RYAN","Hey."
"04","10","10","TAYLOR","Did you read it?"
"04","10","10","RYAN","Yeah."
"04","10","10","TAYLOR","All of it?"
"04","10","10","RYAN","Uh-huh."
"04","10","10","TAYLOR","Oh,God. But I thought you said you..."
"04","10","10","RYAN","Met your ex-husband last night. He was at the bookstore doing a reading."
"04","10","10","TAYLOR","Wait.You met Henri-Michel?How did you know it was him?"
"04","10","10","RYAN","Dirty hair,scarf smells like brie."
"04","10","10","TAYLOR","That's Henri-Michel. I just can't believe this.I mean,did you read every page,even..."
"04","10","10","RYAN","Page 47,yeah."
"04","10","10","TAYLOR","Okay,Ryan,even if I was that limber,you know I would never do that in the Chunnel."
"04","10","10","RYAN","I get that it's not true,and,uh, you know,I'm sorry that I read it after I promised I wouldn't,but seeing the guy in the flesh..."
"04","10","10","TAYLOR","Okay,but where does this leave us because you can't even really look me in the eyes,so that's not a great sign."
"04","10","10","RYAN","I don't know,I... I got to shower and get to work."
"04","10","11","SETH","So you're liking it up here?"
"04","10","11","SETH","Seriously."
"04","10","11","SETH","Good,'cause what I wanted to talk to you about is actually kind of a big deal."
"04","10","11","SETH","Um,I'm actually up here for something else."
"04","10","11","SETH","Oh,you know,just thinking about marrying your daughter."
"04","10","11","SETH","Marry,tie the knot,get hitched; whatever the kids are calling it these days."
"04","10","11","SETH","Well,the median age of married couples is getting increasingly higher, so Summer and I have decided to buck the trend. When the world zigs,we're gonna zag."
"04","10","11","SETH","I said the zig,then the zag,so... Yeah,pretty much."
"04","10","11","SETH","Well,she's cool,right? And,uh,she's pretty easy on the eyes."
"04","10","11","SETH","No. Uh,we thought for a second,but thank God,we dodged that bullet,so no."
"04","10","11","SETH","Unicorns..."
"04","10","11","SETH","So does this mean I have your blessing? They do exist."
"04","10","12","TAYLOR","Henri?"
"04","10","12","TAYLOR","Henri,it's me."
"04","10","12","TAYLOR","Henri,these places come with bathtubs."
"04","10","12","TAYLOR","It wasn't enough that you had to write a book about me,you had to come to my hometown,too?"
"04","10","12","TAYLOR","Good,because if you think for one second that this little trip of yours is going to send me scurrying back to France..."
"04","10","12","TAYLOR","What?No,no,stop that! I just came here to tell you something. I'm with someone now."
"04","10","12","TAYLOR","Yeah,well,he didn't. And if I lose him 'cause of your stupid book..."
"04","10","12","TAYLOR","Hey,up here! So,okay,what are you saying there? You're saying that,what,the three of us should go on a date?"
"04","10","13","JULIE","I apologize about the last guy,Mrs.Jacobson. This one will have his back waxed,I promise. Two cases of toner will be fine.Thanks. Copy machine's acting up again."
"04","10","13","KIRSTEN","It was working five minutes ago."
"04","10","13","JULIE","That's what's so frustrating."
"04","10","13","KIRSTEN","Julie,we need to talk. Ever since Bullet's New Year's Eve party when all of our clients wound up with those young guys..."
"04","10","13","JULIE","How funny was that?"
"04","10","13","KIRSTEN","you've been acting jumpy."
"04","10","13","JULIE","Overworked? 'Cause that's all it is. I really love my job."
"04","10","13","KIRSTEN","I know you do."
"04","10","13","JULIE","Which is why I don't want to see you jeopardize it. I need to get that. New Match,Julie Cooper speaking. Hi.Yes. Yes,of course. Okay,uh-huh.I'll see you.Bye. That was my lunch date. I'm sorry.We'll have to talk later. I'll see you,okay?"
"04","10","13","KIRSTEN","Okay."
"04","10","14","SUMMER","Ready,Pancakes?"
"04","10","14","SUMMER","Hi. I hope I'm wearing the right clothes."
"04","10","14","SUMMER","Nice to meet you,too."
"04","10","14","SUMMER","Oh,thanks. Bottoms up."
"04","10","15","RYAN","Listen,buddy,there's a lot of..."
"04","10","15","TAYLOR","Come on,Taylor,you can do this. He likes you,you like him,he doesn't think you're a big fat divorcee whore. Hi."
"04","10","15","RYAN","Hi."
"04","10","15","TAYLOR","I was just trying to decide between a burrito or a taco. Taco,burrito,big decision."
"04","10","15","RYAN","So you weren't trying to psych yourself up to come talk to me?"
"04","10","15","TAYLOR","No,of course not.Yeah,kind of."
"04","10","15","RYAN","Taylor,look,it's,it's fine.I'll get over it."
"04","10","15","TAYLOR","Really?"
"04","10","15","RYAN","Yeah,just give me some time."
"04","10","15","TAYLOR","Okay,well,there's something that might help speed the healing process."
"04","10","16","SUMMER","Seriously,though,I am so using the champagne fountain."
"04","10","16","SUMMER","No,'cause that's what we're gonna be doing at my house tomorrow night. Am I right,bitches?"
"04","10","16","SUMMER","You know what? I am so down for that juice fast."
"04","10","16","SUMMER","African babies."
"04","10","16","SUMMER","Mm-hmm. Where's the waiter?I need me some more champy. Hey,mama needs some more bubbly."
"04","10","16","SUMMER","Jay?"
"04","10","16","SUMMER","Yeah,just bring on the bubbly."
"04","10","17","KAITLIN","And the best part,these cops,they really are that stupid."
"04","10","17","KAITLIN","Are you kidding ? It's my favorite show. You can't make this stuff up."
"04","10","17","JULIE","Kaitlin,have you seen my cell? Oh,I didn't know you had a friend over."
"04","10","17","KAITLIN","Mom,Will. Will,this is my mother."
"04","10","17","JULIE","Nice to meet you,Will. Well,I wish I could stay and talk some more but I'm gonna go look for my phone at the office. You two look cute together."
"04","10","17","KAITLIN","Mom..."
"04","10","17","JULIE","Enjoy your date."
"04","10","17","KAITLIN","It's not a date."
"04","10","17","JULIE","Have fun."
"04","10","17","KAITLIN","It's not like dinner and a movie or anything."
"04","10","17","KAITLIN","Well,you got me there."
"04","10","17","KAITLIN","Let's just watch this show. That cop,he just drove a car into a meth lab. That's hilarious."
"04","10","17","KAITLIN","Well,maybe it's 'cause you're not high. Do you want to smoke up?"
"04","10","17","KAITLIN","What are you saying?"
"04","10","18","TAYLOR","Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.Am I right?"
"04","10","18","RYAN","So,what are,what are your plans in Newport?"
"04","10","18","TAYLOR","Wait.Ja Pense is coming to Newport?"
"04","10","18","RYAN","What is Ja Pense?"
"04","10","18","TAYLOR","It's this literary talk show. It's kind of like a French Charlie Rose,but with less interrupting."
"04","10","18","TAYLOR","Oh,no,no,Henri,I said the last time was my farewell appearance."
"04","10","18","RYAN","The last time? You used to go on a French talk show?"
"04","10","18","TAYLOR","Just a handful of times,though. My favorite had to be that one roundtable we had Anäis Nin's bisexuality. Things got heat-ed."
"04","10","18","TAYLOR","You... Me? Seriously?"
"04","10","18","RYAN","I don't,I don't know... Nin's poetry."
"04","10","18","TAYLOR","Oh,mm. ""And the day came ""where the risk remained tight ""in the bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. "" C'est tres beau,{a."
"04","10","18","RYAN","Well,I'm exhausted. Uh,would you give Taylor a ride home?"
"04","10","18","TAYLOR","Ryan?"
"04","10","19","TAYLOR","Ryan! Wait! Ryan,what's wrong?"
"04","10","19","RYAN","Nothing. It's just,we've been in there four hours. First course,second course,cheese course..."
"04","10","19","TAYLOR","And you couldn't stop imagining it,right? Me with him,page 47. Ryan,I thought you said you were okay with this?"
"04","10","19","RYAN","I guess I'm not. I'm sorry."
"04","10","19","TAYLOR","Ryan... Ryan!"
"04","10","20","RYAN","Okay,I'll bite. I read the book,Taylor's book."
"04","10","20","SANDY","So you must be feeling..."
"04","10","20","RYAN","I'm not freaked out."
"04","10","20","SANDY","Even page 47?"
"04","10","20","RYAN","No,no,I mean,I was,right? But then,uh,last night we,uh,we went out with her ex. And you know,it was all art and philosophy and how she used to go on that French talk show. And you know that part in the book where she goes out to dinner with Jacques Chirac? That's actually true."
"04","10","21","RYAN","Pretty much."
"04","10","21","SANDY","Well,listen,I don't know anything about the world of French intellectuals, but I do know Taylor Townsend,and seems to me,she thinks you are pretty terrific. So just talk to her. Or you can sit here,reading your Sartre."
"04","10","21","RYAN","I'll talk to her."
"04","10","21","SANDY","Good. Hey,you know who else the French love? Jerry Lewis."
"04","10","21","RYAN","Really?"
"04","10","21","SANDY","Hey,lady! G'bye!"
"04","10","22","JULIE","Hey,babe,how was your date last night?"
"04","10","22","KAITLIN","I already told you,it wasn't a date."
"04","10","22","JULIE","Why not?Will seems nice and very cute."
"04","10","22","KAITLIN","He is,he's a major dork."
"04","10","22","JULIE","You like him."
"04","10","22","KAITLIN","No,I don't."
"04","10","22","JULIE","Oh,my God,you really,really like him."
"04","10","22","KAITLIN","Oh,my God!No,I don't."
"04","10","22","JULIE","You think he's dorkalicious."
"04","10","22","KAITLIN","Stop it."
"04","10","22","JULIE","You want his big dorky arms wrapped around you while he gives you big dorky kisses."
"04","10","22","KAITLIN","Mom,I'm your child."
"04","10","22","JULIE","Sorry."
"04","10","22","KAITLIN","And even if I did like him,which I don't,it doesn't matter 'cause I screwed up,and he doesn't like me anyway."
"04","10","22","JULIE","Whatever it is you did,I'm sure you'll fix it. At the very least,you have to try."
"04","10","22","KAITLIN","What are you doing,anyway?"
"04","10","22","JULIE","My cell phone wasn't at the office."
"04","10","22","KAITLIN","So you think it's in the frying pan?"
"04","10","22","JULIE","I've checked everywhere else,and I just really need it,okay?"
"04","10","22","KAITLIN","Okay."
"04","10","24","RYAN","Taylor?"
"04","10","24","TAYLOR","You don't want to come in here,Ryan. I'm reenacting page 112."
"04","10","24","RYAN","Look,I'm sorry,okay?I... I wasn't freaked out about the s*x,just so you know. It was the,uh,you know,all those people you were talking about,the writers,the philosophers,people I never even heard of. I just thought it was out of our league. I just,I didn't grow up going to the opera or reading French poetry."
"04","10","24","TAYLOR","Ryan,you're just as smart as Henri-Michel,and I don't want you to be anyone else than who you are."
"04","10","24","RYAN","Thank you."
"04","10","24","TAYLOR","God,I wish I hadn't said yes."
"04","10","24","RYAN","What?What did you say yes to?"
"04","10","24","TAYLOR","I agreed to go on Ja Pense tonight. You know,I can cancel it."
"04","10","24","RYAN","No,no,look,I want you to be who you are. In fact,I'd like to come."
"04","10","24","TAYLOR","Uh,okay."
"04","10","24","RYAN","Yeah?"
"04","10","24","TAYLOR","Yeah,sure."
"04","10","24","RYAN","Now,I have a few minutes before I have to get to work. And all that talk about page 112..."
"04","10","24","TAYLOR","Kaitlin's right downstairs."
"04","10","24","RYAN","I know,but my impression of the vicar's very quiet. It's really,you won't even hear it."
"04","10","24","TAYLOR","Really?Really? No.Don't,don't!"
"04","10","25","SETH","So what was the deal with that unicorn?"
"04","10","25","SETH","And speaking of family,have you decided to bless our sacred union?"
"04","10","25","SETH","What?"
"04","10","25","SETH","Look,Dr.Roberts,with all due respect,uh, you have a lot of grounds with which to object to this admittedly harebrained idea, but if there's one thing that is undeniable,it's that I appreciate your daughter."
"04","10","25","SETH","Well,she's hilarious,for one,and my favorite thing in the world is to make her laugh because she has a crazy honk of a laugh I think Nelson from The Simpsons... She does have a contagious laugh. Yeah,stop me before I say that she makes me a better man,but she makes me more of a man. Certainly less of a boy. I love every minute I spend with your daughter,sir.I really do."
"04","10","25","SETH","I do,seriously."
"04","10","26","SUMMER","Oh,girl,you got to get your hot tub,right,huh? Owls... What,are you supposed to be,my conscience?"
"04","10","26","SUMMER","Yes,it is."
"04","10","26","SUMMER","Oh,good for you."
"04","10","26","SUMMER","Thanks. You'd better not watch me change."
"04","10","27","RYAN","Uh,yes,yes.What's happening?"
"04","10","27","RYAN","I like it,and I think it looks good."
"04","10","28","SUMMER","Look,Seth is asking my dad,okay? This wedding is happening,so I need to make the best of it. Will you please stop trying to rescue me?"
"04","10","28","SUMMER","Who's my ringbearer?"
"04","10","28","SUMMER","Pancakes!"
"04","10","28","SUMMER","Pancakes! His name is Pancakes."
"04","10","28","SUMMER","Everything!"
"04","10","29","RYAN","You were amazing."
"04","10","29","TAYLOR","Thank you. Okay,I'm gonna go say good-bye,then I'll be right back."
"04","10","29","RYAN","Okay,all right."
"04","10","29","TAYLOR","Okay."
"04","10","29","RYAN","I thought you guys were great,not that I understood a word of it."
"04","10","29","RYAN","Sounds great.Who's David Hume?"
"04","10","29","RYAN","I'm sure you were"
"04","10","30","TAYLOR","Yeah."
"04","10","30","RYAN","Can I talk to you a second?"
"04","10","30","TAYLOR","Yeah. Excuse me. Thank you.I couldn't get out of there."
"04","10","30","RYAN","Why did you tell him I was writing a book?"
"04","10","30","TAYLOR","What?"
"04","10","30","RYAN","You couldn't tell him the truth,that I work in a Mexican restaurant?"
"04","10","30","TAYLOR","Okay,Ryan,what did you expect me to do? Because you said about three words all night and then you just ran away. Henri asked me if you were on medication."
"04","10","30","RYAN","Oh,so now you care about his opinion?"
"04","10","30","TAYLOR","Yes.Yes,I do. Because I could see him sitting there judging you and I hated it. I just wanted him to know how smart you were. And maybe it was the wrong thing to do,but the story just kind of came spilling out of me."
"04","10","30","RYAN","All right,okay,you lied to make me look good- I get that- but the thing is,I think part of you wishes it were true."
"04","10","30","TAYLOR","No,Ryan,please,I just want you to be yourself."
"04","10","30","RYAN","Taylor... I don't know,I... I think this is what we've known from the beginning."
"04","10","30","TAYLOR","What?What's that?"
"04","10","30","RYAN","We're different."
"04","10","30","TAYLOR","So what?Everyone's different. It's what makes the world beautiful. Right? Okay,Ryan,I'm sorry. What do you want me to do to make it better?"
"04","10","30","RYAN","I think I should go."
"04","10","32","JULIE","Hello? Spencer. No,I didn't get any of your messages. My cell phone's been MIA for two days now. I'm retracing my steps. What do you mean Mrs.Jacobson got canceled on? What...what partner? Oh,my God."
"04","10","33","KIRSTEN","Uh,no,thank you."
"04","10","33","KIRSTEN","Uh,actually,Ken... I'm new at this. Could you walk me through it?"
"04","10","33","KIRSTEN","She did. I just thought... Would you excuse me?I,uh.. I left some toys in-in-in my car. I'll be right back."
"04","10","34","KAITLIN","Hey. I just came to clear a few things up. I like you,okay?"
"04","10","34","KAITLIN","Maybe I messed things up so you can't like me back. But I just wanted you to know that. You don't."
"04","10","34","KAITLIN","Stupid winter clothing drive."
"04","10","34","KAITLIN","Really? Hi,Darryl. Hi,Bill."
"04","10","34","KAITLIN","Okay. Just can't believe this winter clothing drive is salting my game."
"04","10","35","JULIE","Kirsten,I can explain."
"04","10","35","KIRSTEN","That you've been running a prostitution ring through our business."
"04","10","35","JULIE","It... it just...it just happened."
"04","10","35","KIRSTEN","There are dozens of names here. Hercules,Commander Snake..."
"04","10","35","JULIE","Kirsten,I am so sorry,but I promise..."
"04","10","35","KIRSTEN","I have known you a long time,Julie. This isn't just a matter of cloudy judgment and questionable morals. It's breaking federal law."
"04","10","35","JULIE","I understand. I do. And I deeply,deeply regret it,but if we just quit now,we can act like it never happened."
"04","10","35","KIRSTEN","I wish I could. I want you out of here by Monday."
"04","10","35","JULIE","Kirsten,please."
"04","10","35","KIRSTEN","I'm going to do you one more favor. I'm not going to call the police and I'm not going to tell Sandy. You're on your own."
"04","10","36","SUMMER","Hello?"
"04","10","36","SUMMER","You're calling me now? Look,I already sent them all home.Isn't that enough?"
"04","10","36","SUMMER","Wait,where are you?"
"04","10","36","SUMMER","God,I'm okay now. I just...kind of got engaged."
"04","10","36","SUMMER","Jay,I'm so confused. I don't know what I want."
"04","10","37","SANDY","Oh,man sitting by himself in the dark. It's not a good sign. Are you okay?"
"04","10","37","RYAN","I've been better. I don't know what's going on with me and Taylor. I think maybe we're just too different."
"04","10","37","SANDY","You said that like it's a bad thing. Look at Kirsten and me."
"04","10","37","RYAN","Right. Well,you know,you guys have your own rhythm."
"04","10","37","SANDY","Well,yeah,it took years to figure that out. I love Kirsten dearly,and-and... and still it gets complicated."
"04","10","37","RYAN","So how do you know you know,whether you're good,different or just..."
"04","10","37","SANDY","From opposite planets?"
"04","10","37","RYAN","Right."
"04","10","37","SANDY","At the end of the day,you either focus on what separates you or you focus on what holds you together. And it's up to you."
"04","10","38","SETH","Hey,stranger."
"04","10","38","SUMMER","Hi. How was Seattle?"
"04","10","38","SETH","It was good,good."
"04","10","38","SUMMER","Yeah?"
"04","10","38","SETH","Yeah."
"04","10","38","SUMMER","How was my dad when you asked him? Cold,warm,lukewarm?"
"04","10","38","SETH","Well,he did not give us permission to get married,at least for the next few years."
"04","10","38","SUMMER","damn."
"04","10","38","SETH","Yeah. Okay,well,uh,here's,here's the deal. I went up there,knowing your dad would say no and that I could get out of this, but I realized I don't want out. I want in with you. forever,you know? So,I think we should stay engaged. It doesn't have to be today,but... someday."
"04","10","38","SUMMER","Seth,I realized something,too,while you were gone. It turns out I have no idea who I am. In the past few months,I went from being a hard-core environmentalist to a Newpsie-wed in training."
"04","10","38","SETH","You're a Newpsie?"
"04","10","38","SUMMER","For 48 hours. The point is,I don't think that you can be with someone until you can be with yourself. I think it's something I need to figure out."
"04","10","38","SETH","Oh,that sounds like a..."
"04","10","38","SUMMER","I guess it's a no. I'm sorry."
"04","10","38","SETH","Well,I think I'm gonna..."
"04","10","38","SUMMER","I'm going to see you tomorrow,okay?"
"04","10","38","SETH","Okay."
"04","10","38","SUMMER","Hey... you should take this... because we might need it someday. Please,don't be sad,Peaches."
"04","10","39","TAYLOR","Nothing.It's just...thought... Nothing...You know,it's getting late,Henri,so I should go."
"04","10","39","TAYLOR","Okay."
"04","11","0","SETH","Dude, I asked the girl to marry me."
"04","11","0","RYAN","Yeah, and she said no. It's not like she broke up with you."
"04","11","0","SETH","That would have been better. Someone says they don't want to marry you, you're supposed to break up. Now we got to keep on dating like everything is normal, when there's this gi-normous... Elephant in the room."
"04","11","0","RYAN","Yeah, there's an elephant?"
"04","11","0","SETH","Yeah, the ""I don't want to marry you"" elephant."
"04","11","0","RYAN","All right, look. There's no elephant, and there's no breakup."
"04","11","1","TAYLOR","It's a breakup. How else do you explain, 17 unreturned phone calls?"
"04","11","1","SUMMER","Seventeen?"
"04","11","1","TAYLOR","The first 12 were apologies for that stupid lie I told Henri about Ryan. And after that, it was just kind of a blur. Sooner or later, he has to call me back, right?"
"04","11","2","RYAN","I'll call her when I'm ready."
"04","11","2","SETH","What?"
"04","11","2","RYAN","She lied to me about, her French ex-husband."
"04","11","2","SETH","And she also apologized. Taylor doesn't respond well to neglect, man. You should call her."
"04","11","2","RYAN","Yeah? Maybe you should call Summer."
"04","11","3","TAYLOR","Is that Seth?"
"04","11","3","SUMMER","Che. I'll call him back. He's flying here. He was feeling weird Seth vibes."
"04","11","3","TAYLOR","All the way from Rhode Island?"
"04","11","4","TAYLOR","No, Henri-Michel."
"04","11","4","SUMMER","God, Frenchie's really putting on the full-court press,huh?"
"04","11","4","TAYLOR","Yeah. Nothing's happened yet, though. I keep telling him I've got a boyfriend. Even though, technically, I guess I don't anymore."
"04","11","4","SUMMER","You know, I think Ryan's just waiting for Henri to go back to the motherland."
"04","11","5","RYAN","She said in her message he's still in town. Until he leaves, we can't have a real conversation."
"04","11","5","SETH","I don't get it, when is he leaving?"
"04","11","6","TAYLOR","That's just it, he's not leaving. He's renting a house in Newport, and he asked me to move in with him."
"04","11","6","SUMMER","What? You're not considering it, are you?"
"04","11","6","TAYLOR","It's just that I've been mooching off of you and Julie for months now, and I've lived with Henri-Michel before, and he's really not a bad roommate, you know, aside from his natural odor and... I don't know, maybe I can force myself to fall in love with him."
"04","11","6","SUMMER","Why would you want to do that?"
"04","11","6","TAYLOR","Because I'm going to need some help getting over Ryan."
"04","11","6","SUMMER","They're going to call."
"04","11","7","RYAN","Maybe we should call."
"04","11","8","TAYLOR","They're going to call. Right?"
"04","11","9","SUMMER","Atwood."
"04","11","9","RYAN","Hey, Roberts."
"04","11","9","SUMMER","Hey, look, I'm sorry to bother you at work, but I just really needed to talk to you."
"04","11","9","RYAN","Oh, no macho nacho supreme?"
"04","11","9","SUMMER","No."
"04","11","9","RYAN","Are you sure? It's really good."
"04","11","9","SUMMER","How's Seth? See, I kind of turned down his proposal and never heard from him again."
"04","11","9","RYAN","Proposal? That's the first time I'm hearing about it."
"04","11","9","SUMMER","Right. For a week now, Seth has been off the map. You expect me to believe that not once did he mention anything about a proposal going awry?"
"04","11","9","RYAN","Right, well, he had pinkeye."
"04","11","9","SUMMER","Pinkeye? Did you have pinkeye, too?"
"04","11","9","RYAN","What? Why?"
"04","11","9","SUMMER","Well, 'cause Taylor said she didn't hear from you either, and she was asking about you."
"04","11","9","RYAN","Well, see, that was 'cause I was, I was helping him with his recovery. And waiting for Henri-Michel to leave."
"04","11","9","SUMMER","Actually, I don't really mean to be the bearer of bad news, but he's looking for a house to rent in Newport."
"04","11","9","RYAN","Great."
"04","11","10","SETH","Summer? Hey, Che, what are you doing here?"
"04","11","10","SETH","I guess I meant what are you doing in Summer's living room?"
"04","11","10","SETH","Fig?"
"04","11","10","SETH","What?"
"04","11","10","SETH","Well..."
"04","11","10","SETH","Yeah. No, that was just my sciatica acting up."
"04","11","10","SETH","My masculinity is intact."
"04","11","10","SETH","Thank you, but, you know, I'm good. I'm very good."
"04","11","10","SUMMER","Hey."
"04","11","10","SETH","Summer. Hi."
"04","11","10","SUMMER","Your pinkeye is all clear."
"04","11","10","SETH","Pinkeye?"
"04","11","10","SUMMER","Yeah. The reason why I haven't heard from you. I talked to Ryan."
"04","11","10","SETH","Yeah, when it gets in your eye, it goes, it goes pink. I'm great."
"04","11","10","SUMMER","You are?"
"04","11","10","SETH","Yes."
"04","11","10","SUMMER","Good. 'Cause I missed you. Tonight, we are going to have a date."
"04","11","10","SETH","Hey, a date sounds perfect."
"04","11","10","SUMMER","A romantic date."
"04","11","10","SETH","Aren't they all, Summer? Aren't they all? High fives all around. High fives...all around. Seriously, I'm good. eI'll see you tonight for this date."
"04","11","10","SUMMER","I wouldn't leave town just yet."
"04","11","11","TAYLOR","There's lots of closet space. Plenty of room for your pants. Each pair could have its own walk-in."
"04","11","11","TAYLOR","Henri, are you sure you really want to move here?"
"04","11","11","TAYLOR","You see, that is very brave of you. You're really putting yourself out there. You're really taking an emotional risk. Unlike some people."
"04","11","11","TAYLOR","No, and you would think that he would at least have the decency to dump me on the phone. But it's fine, though. I'm fine, because Ryan and I were never really going to work, anyway. He doesn't even like cheese."
"04","11","11","TAYLOR","You know, it's probably good that you came back when you did, before Ryan and I got any more serious."
"04","11","11","TAYLOR","Oh, no, no. Henri, you don't have to say that."
"04","11","11","TAYLOR","Wow, That's uh, okay, yeah, say it a thousand times."
"04","11","12","KAITLIN","Look, I got my first non-cheating A. Your tutoring is really paying off."
"04","11","12","KAITLIN","Yeah, I guess you can learn chemistry from making out. I actually did some studying after you left. I guess your work ethic is kind of contagious. Let's see what else I can catch. Um, why is this girl staring at me?"
"04","11","12","KAITLIN","No kidding."
"04","11","12","KAITLIN","What's Friday night?"
"04","11","12","KAITLIN","Band geeks and baking goods. Definitely sounds like the feel-good hit of the year."
"04","11","12","KAITLIN","Well, I do have a Latin test coming up. Maybe you can help me study."
"04","11","13","KIRSTEN","New Match."
"04","11","13","JULIE","Hi, Kiki, don't hang up."
"04","11","13","KIRSTEN","You turn our businessinto a prostitution ring, and you get hung up on company policy. New Match."
"04","11","13","JULIE","Did you at least get my cookie bouquet?"
"04","11","13","KIRSTEN","I'm allergic to chocolate."
"04","11","13","JULIE","No, you're not."
"04","11","13","KIRSTEN","Then I'm allergic to you."
"04","11","13","JULIE","Just tell me how long you're gonna be mad at me about this."
"04","11","13","KIRSTEN","You're kidding, right?"
"04","11","13","JULIE","Kirsten, our friendship can't just end like this. There must be something I can do."
"04","11","13","KIRSTEN","If you'll excuse me, I have a legitimate business to run and that doesn't involve hookers."
"04","11","14","KAITLIN","Ryan. Finally."
"04","11","14","RYAN","Is Taylor in?"
"04","11","14","KAITLIN","You know, she's been asking about you every day this week."
"04","11","14","RYAN","I'm here now."
"04","11","14","KAITLIN","She's not. Try the Four Seasons."
"04","11","14","RYAN","Where her French ex-husband is staying? All right, I guess I can head over there."
"04","11","14","KAITLIN","So what did you end up getting her?"
"04","11","14","RYAN","Huh?"
"04","11","14","KAITLIN","Don't tell me you came with no gift."
"04","11","14","RYAN","I don't need a gift."
"04","11","14","KAITLIN","Ryan, Pep Le Pew is buying her a house."
"04","11","14","RYAN","She's moving in with him?"
"04","11","14","KAITLIN","You honestly got her nothing? I mean, you couldn't have gone to the Quickie Mart to get her a stuffed animal and some gummy bears?"
"04","11","14","RYAN","Gummy bears."
"04","11","14","KAITLIN","Talk is cheap, Ryan. If you're going toe-to-toe with this Frenchie, you're going to need to step your game up."
"04","11","14","RYAN","I can't believe I'm getting advice from a 15-year-old."
"04","11","14","KAITLIN","A 15-year-old who's right."
"04","11","15","SETH","Okay, so the big date's in your bedroom?"
"04","11","15","SUMMER","Uh, yeah."
"04","11","15","SETH","You saved some money on gas."
"04","11","15","SUMMER","Ryan lent me some videogames. There's Thai takeout and some of your favorite whiny records. And... I still really love you. But, I hope we get married someday, I'm just not ready now."
"04","11","15","SETH","Hey, forget the whole thing ever happened. I know I have."
"04","11","15","SUMMER","I don't want to forget about it. What you did was amazing. It was so sweet. The words you said and how sincere you were when you said them. And the glow-in-the-dark ring, it was so cute."
"04","11","15","SETH","Yeah, it's so hot in here."
"04","11","15","SUMMER","Yeah, that's a good thing."
"04","11","15","SETH","No, I, I think the...air conditioning is broken or something, maybe."
"04","11","15","SUMMER","It's winter."
"04","11","15","SETH","I'm going to go get a glass of water. Do you want anything?"
"04","11","15","SUMMER","No."
"04","11","15","SETH","No water?"
"04","11","15","SUMMER","Seth."
"04","11","16","SETH","Hey, Che."
"04","11","16","SETH","Not good, I know. So, the thing you said about my animus..."
"04","11","16","SETH","And you can fix me?"
"04","11","17","SUMMER","Hey, Seth, it's me. Just calling to see how you're feeling. Hope that crazy 24-hour flu thing cleared up. And, uh... also I don't believe that you have the flu. Okay, bye."
"04","11","18","SETH","Are you sure I don't need to bring my phone? It's got GPS. What if we get lost?"
"04","11","18","SETH","What about a jacket? What if it's cold?"
"04","11","19","SUMMER","Oh, Crap."
"04","11","20","RYAN","I'm actually looking for Taylor. Kaitlin told me she was hanging out here. But if she's not around..."
"04","11","20","RYAN","Monday? All right, well, look. If you could just, um, tell her I stopped by."
"04","11","20","RYAN","Uh? It's noth...it's stupid."
"04","11","20","RYAN","Gummy bears."
"04","11","20","RYAN","Yeah."
"04","11","20","RYAN","You know what? No, it's fine. Really, it's from the Quickie Mart and..."
"04","11","20","RYAN","It is more fulfilling if Taylor chooses me in spite of you wanting her back."
"04","11","20","RYAN","All right."
"04","11","21","KIRSTEN","Hello?"
"04","11","21","KIRSTEN","She doesn't work here anymore, Spencer. You should call her at home."
"04","11","21","KIRSTEN","What problem could we possibly have?"
"04","11","21","KIRSTEN","I most certainly will not. It's up to you and Julie."
"04","11","22","KAITLIN","Oh, hi friend of Will's. Nice hat."
"04","11","22","KAITLIN","What'd you just call me?"
"04","11","22","KAITLIN","I'd definitely like to see that happen."
"04","11","22","KAITLIN","And I happen to be going to second with the guy that you like. Go. Now. Before the Munchkins ask for their mayor back."
"04","11","22","KAITLIN","What, you going to blow your little trumpet at me until I cry? You know, I was thinking about doing something fun tomorrow night. But now I think I will go to your little geek fest and buy some brownies."
"04","11","23","TAYLOR","I am exhausted. If I have to look at one more mid-Century sofa, I'm going to kill somebody."
"04","11","23","TAYLOR","Yeah, it's just, you know, I saw this special on hotel rooms, and they search them with UV lights and, gah, you don't want to know."
"04","11","23","TAYLOR","You know what this makes me feel? This makes me feel... nothing. Now tell me again why you love me."
"04","11","24","JULIE","Kiki, you're calling me."
"04","11","24","KIRSTEN","I'm delivering a message. Spencer called. It seems that one of your whores, Chaz, has chlamydia."
"04","11","24","JULIE","Chlamydia, ooh, that's rough."
"04","11","24","KIRSTEN","Well, all the women that this guy slept with is going to have to be informed. Spencer says you have a list."
"04","11","24","JULIE","Yes, of course. I'll drop it off tomorrow."
"04","11","24","KIRSTEN","Drop it off? Julie, I am not doing this. You're going to have to tell them."
"04","11","24","JULIE","Well, Kirsten, I'd love to, but I kind of don't work at New Match anymore."
"04","11","24","KIRSTEN","Oh, no, no, no. You are not making this my responsibility."
"04","11","24","JULIE","How about a compromise?"
"04","11","24","KIRSTEN","I'm listening."
"04","11","24","JULIE","We do it together."
"04","11","24","KIRSTEN","I'm not facing those women."
"04","11","24","JULIE","I'll do the talking, you drive."
"04","11","24","KIRSTEN","And how come you can't drive?"
"04","11","24","JULIE","Oh, I'm sorry, do you want to do the talking? It was our company. You're liable."
"04","11","24","KIRSTEN","I'll pick you up in the morning."
"04","11","24","JULIE","I'll find my little black book."
"04","11","25","SUMMER","Come on, Taylor, I need you to come over. Because I am making dinner. A gourmet dinner. And I know you, more than anyone appreciate fine food. What am I making? I am making quail and some caviar. Maybe even a soufflé. That is not over my head, okay? For your information, I recently made a brisket and it was delightful. Okay, great, I will see you soon. Bye."
"04","11","25","RYAN","So she's coming."
"04","11","25","SUMMER","Now you're going to tell me why I just had to lie to my friend?"
"04","11","25","RYAN","Uh, because I need to see her."
"04","11","25","SUMMER","Because?"
"04","11","25","RYAN","I need to tell her how I feel."
"04","11","25","SUMMER","Mm-hmm."
"04","11","25","RYAN","What?"
"04","11","25","SUMMER","Nothing. You just don't really strike me as the coffee cart type."
"04","11","25","RYAN","And what does that mean?"
"04","11","25","SUMMER","Look, I'm sure you have changed being with Taylor made you more expressive, but articulating your feelings to your girlfriend kind of a challenge."
"04","11","25","RYAN","Yeah, but if I don't make some sort of declaration..."
"04","11","25","SUMMER","You might lose her. Okay, you just need to take a deep breath, look inside and say what's from your heart."
"04","11","25","RYAN","I can do that."
"04","11","25","SUMMER","Good. One more thing."
"04","11","25","RYAN","Yeah?"
"04","11","25","SUMMER","Taylor has a super big heart, and she's super forgiving, but, uh, there is a French guy circling like a great white shark."
"04","11","25","RYAN","Okay, you're just reminding me of the stakes."
"04","11","25","SUMMER","No. I'm giving you advice because you're my friend and I really want you to work this out."
"04","11","25","RYAN","All right, I'm listening, I'm listening."
"04","11","25","SUMMER","Do not choke."
"04","11","25","RYAN","Okay, I wasn't going to until you did that."
"04","11","25","SUMMER","You kind of have a wide neck."
"04","11","25","RYAN","Yeah, you got really small hands. Thanks for the advice."
"04","11","25","SUMMER","No problem."
"04","11","26","SETH","Are we almost there yet?"
"04","11","26","SETH","Uh, actually, I think they do. You still haven't told me what we're doing here."
"04","11","26","SETH","Boy, I sure feel better. Can we go back now? We've been hiking for hours. I'm exhausted and I'm starving and my ass is cramping up."
"04","11","26","SETH","And then we can go home?"
"04","11","26","SETH","What?"
"04","11","26","SETH","Che, look at me. We're not staying here. Where's the car?"
"04","11","27","TAYLOR","Summer! Summer, where are you? Summer? God, you call someone, the least you can do is show up... Ryan, what are you doing here?"
"04","11","27","RYAN","I had Summer call you.I'm sorry. I wanted to talk to you."
"04","11","27","TAYLOR","Well, it worked, weasel. What do you want?"
"04","11","27","RYAN","I wanted to apologize. I made a mistake."
"04","11","27","TAYLOR","When? When you abandoned me, on the set of a French talk show? Or when you didn't call me for a week?"
"04","11","27","RYAN","All of the above?"
"04","11","27","TAYLOR","Well, you hurt me, Ryan. Why couldn't you just have had faith in us?"
"04","11","27","RYAN","I don't know, I guess I thought we were too different."
"04","11","27","TAYLOR","Maybe you were right."
"04","11","27","RYAN","No, I know I wasn't. And I realize now that how we feel is much more important than what we have to talk about."
"04","11","27","TAYLOR","And how do you feel?"
"04","11","27","RYAN","I... I..."
"04","11","27","TAYLOR","That stuffed animal that you bought me is more expressive, Ryan. Henri-Michel is reading a poem that he wrote for me at the bookstore tomorrow night. It's a love poem Ryan, and it's long."
"04","11","28","SETH","Shut up, Che."
"04","11","28","SETH","I'm deranged. I haven't been to sleep, I haven't eaten."
"04","11","29","JULIE","All done. She took it pretty well."
"04","11","29","KIRSTEN","Excuse me. Fiona."
"04","11","29","KIRSTEN","I'm really sorry to have to tell you this. One of Julie's boys..."
"04","11","29","KIRSTEN","Look, I understand that you're really upset, but I don't think you want to take this to court. The publicity alone..."
"04","11","29","JULIE","That was brilliant."
"04","11","29","KIRSTEN","You had to do one thing."
"04","11","29","JULIE","I choked, I'm sorry. I promise, next person I really will tell. Or we could get our nails done. Oh, okay."
"04","11","30","TAYLOR","So what do Brutus, Judas, Benedict, Arnold... Julius Rosenberg, Ethel Rosenberg, although that's debatable, and you have in common?"
"04","11","30","SUMMER","Uh, we all did what we thought was right."
"04","11","30","TAYLOR","Eyes rolling."
"04","11","30","SUMMER","I'm sorry about yesterday, okay? But Ryan looked like a poor, sad koala bear, and I'm trying to help animals."
"04","11","30","TAYLOR","Yeah, why does your room look like a bird cage?"
"04","11","30","SUMMER","Because I decided its time to get off my butt and do something with my life. I'm going to start a nonprofit. You know, I read that if you can just focus on saving one animal, you can really make an impact. Did you read this article? It's how we're giving elephants post-traumatic stress disorder."
"04","11","30","TAYLOR","Those poor elephants. All they want is to be cared for and nurtured and, not left on the set of a European talk show after party by their stupid, stupid..."
"04","11","30","SUMMER","Ryan?"
"04","11","30","TAYLOR","Yeah. And speaking of stupid, did you see the totaly Quickie Mart teddy bear that he brought me?"
"04","11","30","SUMMER","Ryan bought you a stuffed animal? Oh, my God. Look, in all the time I've known him, I've never seen him do anything so sweet."
"04","11","30","TAYLOR","Never?"
"04","11","30","SUMMER","Never. That's probably the nicest gift he's ever given."
"04","11","30","TAYLOR","I, uh, I should go."
"04","11","31","SANDY","You going for a run?"
"04","11","31","RYAN","Yeah, I'm just trying to clear my head."
"04","11","31","SANDY","Yeah, I saw that your light was on pretty late last night."
"04","11","31","RYAN","Yeah. Yeah, I was trying to think of a good gift for Taylor."
"04","11","31","SANDY","Oh, so what did you come up with?"
"04","11","31","RYAN","You know the Quickie Mart down by the pier?"
"04","11","31","SANDY","Yeah?"
"04","11","31","RYAN","They had a special on a bear with a mug of candy."
"04","11","31","SANDY","So you didn't quite hit it out of the park, did you?"
"04","11","31","RYAN","I may have done more harm than good."
"04","11","31","SANDY","You know, it is obvious to almost everyone, that Taylor feels very strongly about you."
"04","11","31","RYAN","Well, Henri-Michel said he loved her. He wrote her a book and he's performing some poem about it. And then she asked me if I felt the same..."
"04","11","31","SANDY","You couldn't say anything. Between us, how do you feel about her?"
"04","11","31","RYAN","Well, being with Taylor's like being on a roller coaster."
"04","11","31","SANDY","And that's what, unsettling?"
"04","11","31","RYAN","For a guy who' afraid of heights, it's not exactly the best fit, but, uh... I don't know, it's exciting I guess."
"04","11","31","SANDY","Tell her that, before it's too late. Tell her that. This is all I know."
"04","11","31","RYAN","Hmm?"
"04","11","31","SANDY","A situation like this, you could do something, you could do nothing. It's as simple as that."
"04","11","31","RYAN","All right."
"04","11","31","SANDY","Do something."
"04","11","31","RYAN","Yeah, see you around."
"04","11","31","SANDY","A mug!"
"04","11","32","TAYLOR","I was making sure that the maid service here is efficient."
"04","11","32","TAYLOR","Well, the guy did get me a gift and, the balloon was really shiny."
"04","11","32","TAYLOR","Really?"
"04","11","32","TAYLOR","Well, I don't know if I would use the word adored exactly."
"04","11","32","TAYLOR","I want to be with somebody who really wants to be with me, and who's not afraid to say it."
"04","11","32","TAYLOR","Okay."
"04","11","33","SETH","Then we can sleep?"
"04","11","33","SETH","No, I um, actually, I found some berries down below. They were pretty tasty, so..."
"04","11","33","SETH","Yeah, why? Is there a problem?"
"04","11","34","KAITLIN","He guys."
"04","11","34","KAITLIN","Okay, well, that's definitely a knee-slapper. Will, do you mind getting me a soda?"
"04","11","34","KAITLIN","Hum, actually, I'm going to stay here and talk to Lucy."
"04","11","34","KAITLIN","Just sur you have it clear, the only reason that I'm here is because I know you don't want me to be. So get ready to have some fun."
"04","11","34","KAITLIN","Girls like me. What, girls who don't like wearing polyester pantsuits or baking pies earing lame feathered hats?"
"04","11","35","SETH","Like I'm sharing a sauna with Blue Man Group."
"04","11","35","SETH","Ryan likes Journey !"
"04","11","36","SETH","Dad? Mom? Che ? Che? I'm scared. Oh, I guess that's the idea. Is that you making all that noise? I can hear you. What's that, little fella? You don't feel well? That's okay, I can take care of you. I don't exactly know what that means, but maybe, maybe I can get you back in the ocean. With all your otter friends. And you can do otter-related activities. Don't worry. I'm here. It's going to be okay."
"04","11","37","SETH","Oh, Che. Che, wake up. I had the greatest dream."
"04","11","37","SETH","And I just healed my animal spirit. I've got to get back home to Summer."
"04","11","37","SETH","Oh, it was so cute, man. It was a... It was this otter, and it was lost."
"04","11","37","SETH","Yeah, why is that okay?"
"04","11","37","SETH","Is that bad?"
"04","11","37","SETH","Good. Great, ok, 'cause I thought like, it would suck if it wasn't. But we should get out of here."
"04","11","38","RYAN","Wait."
"04","11","38","TAYLOR","Ryan, what are you doing?"
"04","11","38","RYAN","I have a poem too."
"04","11","39","RYAN","Thank you. A sonnet... I don't know how to write. A haiku, Five, seven, five... seems... too tight. I'm sorry, I think this is a bad idea."
"04","11","39","TAYLOR","Then there are three little words I'm not able to say. But Taylor, this is what I can tell you today. Though I can't say those words to you tonight, please stick with me, 'cause I feel someday I might."
"04","11","39","RYAN","Look, uh, Taylor, I know that my poem might not be quite as good as Henri-Michel's, but I wanted you to know how I feel."
"04","11","39","TAYLOR","No, Ryan, I loved it. I really..."
"04","11","39","TAYLOR","I'm sorry."
"04","11","40","JULIE","We had a good day. Three out of five women now know they've been exposed to a sexually-transmitted disease, we should be proud."
"04","11","40","KIRSTEN","No, You're on your own for the next two."
"04","11","40","JULIE","Okay, I understand."
"04","11","40","KIRSTEN","Aren't you supposed to be in Mexico?"
"04","11","40","KIRSTEN","So you mean..."
"04","11","40","KIRSTEN","What?!"
"04","11","40","JULIE","Kirsten, I'm sorry. It was the only way I could think to get you to spend the day with me."
"04","11","40","KIRSTEN","So you told all those women they have chlamydia when they don't?"
"04","11","40","JULIE","They might. They did have s*x with male hookers. Plus, I picked the five meanest women in Newport."
"04","11","40","KIRSTEN","What is wrong with you?"
"04","11","40","JULIE","I was desperate. I missed you. I hate not having you in my life, Kirsten. I can live without you as my business partner, but not without you as my friend."
"04","11","40","KIRSTEN","You are going to call all those women tomorrow, and you are going to tell them the truth."
"04","11","40","JULIE","Okay, but not Linda. Please let Linda think she has an STD. That is not only unethical, it is just plain mean."
"04","11","40","KIRSTEN","I disagree."
"04","11","40","JULIE","Do you want to debate about it over dinner? You know you miss me. Come on, say yes. Kirsten?"
"04","11","41","KAITLIN","You know, you've been in here for so long I was afraid you got flushed down."
"04","11","41","KAITLIN","Hi."
"04","11","41","KAITLIN","Look, I'm sorry that Will doesn't like you back, but I didn't do anything."
"04","11","41","KAITLIN","Yes, I do. I mean, he's smart and he's hot and he's an excellent kisser."
"04","11","41","KAITLIN","Because that's just what I do. I mean, I make fun of everyone, usually 'cause I'm high."
"04","11","41","KAITLIN","You don't know what you're talking about."
"04","11","41","KAITLIN","Shut up, okay? Just shut up."
"04","11","42","TAYLOR","Henri? Henri?I love you, but I love love more. And I don't want to be alone in it. Au revoir, Peaches."
"04","11","43","SANDY","Hey, I've been worried about you. You okay?"
"04","11","43","KIRSTEN","Oh, I'm okay. It's a long story."
"04","11","43","SANDY","Well,I can't wait to hear it. When are you coming home?"
"04","11","43","KIRSTEN","Soon. I'm having dinner with Julie."
"04","11","43","SANDY","Julie?"
"04","11","43","KIRSTEN","Yeah. She is the most manipulative, scheming partner in the world, and it was stupid ever to get into business with her, and I'll never make that mistake again."
"04","11","43","SANDY","But she's the best friend you got."
"04","11","43","KIRSTEN","Something like that."
"04","11","44","KAITLIN","Well, I thought tomorrow was night two of your dorked-out bake sale."
"04","11","44","KAITLIN","But I thought it was important to you."
"04","11","44","KAITLIN","I just thought, you know that, they wouldn't know what to do without you. Since you're the king of dorks and all."
"04","11","44","KAITLIN","Well, after observing you in your natural environment, it was just clear, we're not a good fit. We're like oil and that, other thing."
"04","11","44","KAITLIN","You know who else is a dork, is that Lucy chick. I mean, she's got a pretty hot bod for a dork. I mean, if I was a dork like you, I'd totally go for her."
"04","11","44","KAITLIN","Good, 'cause I think Brad and Eric are down there, probably night surfing or something. So I'll see you around."
"04","11","45","JULIE","Che, what are you still doing here?"
"04","11","45","JULIE","Oh, God, we've got to change the locks."
"04","11","46","SUMMER","Whoa, hi."
"04","11","46","SETH","I healed my spirit animal and I'm ready to love again."
"04","11","46","SUMMER","Did you say spirit animal?"
"04","11","46","SETH","Yeah, and it was lost, but through my connection to the ancient rituals of the Earth, I was able to save my inner otter."
"04","11","48","SUMMER","Otters are so cute. Oh, my gosh, their whiskers and how they use their belly to crack open their abalone dinner. I am going to start a foundation to save the sea otters. Do you know there are less than 3,000 left, in California?"
"04","11","48","SETH","No, that's really sad."
"04","11","49","JULIE","You found lovewith an otter? I'm happy for you."
"04","11","50","SETH","Summer."
"04","11","50","SUMMER","What?"
"04","11","50","SETH","Do you think the otters could wait till tomorrow?"
"04","11","50","SUMMER","No."
"04","11","51","TAYLOR","Henri-Michel's gone."
"04","11","51","RYAN","He's gone? Gone where?"
"04","11","51","TAYLOR","Back to France, I guess."
"04","11","51","RYAN","Why? Uh, I think he understood even better than I did that as much as he loved me, I didn't love him, and I probably never will."
"04","11","51","TAYLOR","When Henri-Michel would tell me he loved me, it was like the whole world melted away. Those words just have more power over me than anything. It's scary how much I want, how much I need, to hear them."
"04","11","51","RYAN","Well, if that's, important to you..."
"04","11","51","TAYLOR","I would never ask you to be able to say that yet. And even if you could, I don't think I'm ready to hear it."
"04","11","51","RYAN","So what are you saying?"
"04","11","51","TAYLOR","Until I can be stronger, on my own, I don't think that I should be with anyone, including you. I'm sorry."
"04","11","51","RYAN","Okay. Actually, that makes sense."
"04","11","51","TAYLOR","But I'm going to treasure this poem forever."
"04","11","51","RYAN","I meant it. Just so you know."
"04","11","51","TAYLOR","I do. Bye, Ryan."
"04","12","0","TAYLOR","Hello."
"04","12","0","KAITLIN","Taylor, where are you? I thought you were going to come to dinner."
"04","12","0","TAYLOR","Oh, uh... you should just go on without me. I haven't finished my errands yet."
"04","12","0","KAITLIN","Wait, you've been gone all day."
"04","12","0","TAYLOR","Well, I had to go to the dry cleaner and get my nails done and then go to the Matthew Barney exhibition."
"04","12","0","KAITLIN","Oh, okay. Well, is Ryan with you?"
"04","12","0","TAYLOR","No, Kaitlin, I told you. We're giving each other some space. I haven't spoken to him in over a week."
"04","12","0","KAITLIN","Okay, well then, I guess you're not going to Kirsten's thing."
"04","12","0","TAYLOR","What thing?"
"04","12","0","KAITLIN","Her party. She's turning 40. I was kind of hoping that you were going to be there to do something weird,so it's not so boring. Wait, do you want to know where it is?"
"04","12","0","TAYLOR","No. Uh-uh. I don't. Uh... I have to go. Good-bye."
"04","12","0","TAYLOR","Yes?"
"04","12","0","TAYLOR","Why? What are you talking about?"
"04","12","0","TAYLOR","Loitering. What's loitering? I've been... just..."
"04","12","0","TAYLOR","These... are for bird watching. Mm-hmm. There's a very interesting oriole in that tree right there."
"04","12","0","TAYLOR","Okay, Ryan's off work in ten minutes. Can you just give me a... Ten minutes! You want a donut?"
"04","12","1","JULIE","Hey, Taylor's not joining us?"
"04","12","1","KAITLIN","Nope. Lucky her."
"04","12","1","JULIE","Sorry this isn't up to your standards, honey."
"04","12","1","KAITLIN","I'm a little short on cash right now. So why'd you leave New Match?"
"04","12","1","JULIE","Because Kirsten and I are better friends than business partners, okay? Could we just leave it at that? Excuse me."
"04","12","1","KAITLIN","Five people in this house and I end up eating dinner by myself."
"04","12","1","JULIE","Hi. So we're still on for Friday, right? Well, I don't like sneaking around either, but we don't have much of a choice, do we? I know, I miss you, too. What? Oh, no, that's just Summer's boyfriend Che. Hold on, um, I'll go outside, okay?"
"04","12","2","SUMMER","Che, what are you doing?"
"04","12","2","SUMMER","What are you trying to figure out?"
"04","12","2","SUMMER","That's great."
"04","12","2","SUMMER","That's interesting. Um... Che? Nothing against Chinese mystics, but, uh, if you want to find out if someone's your soul mate, why don't you just try spending time with them?"
"04","12","2","SUMMER","Yeah. Why not? See if you have anything in common."
"04","12","2","SUMMER","I've heard about the festival. They put him onstage with the mayor and if he sees his shadow, it means six more weeks of winter. Which is crazy considering we don't even have winter to begin with. But I think they treat him okay."
"04","12","2","SUMMER","Just don't involve me 'cause that's how I got kicked out of Brown. You coming to dinner?"
"04","12","2","SUMMER","Of course."
"04","12","3","SANDY","Are you sure you don't want to come?"
"04","12","3","KIRSTEN","Watching a movie about a guy eating a live octopus? I think I'll pass."
"04","12","3","SANDY","It's also got one of the greatest fight sequences in probably the last five years."
"04","12","3","RYAN","Oh, yeah, that'll convince her."
"04","12","3","SETH","Listen, Mom, what better way to see out your 30s than a little South Korean shock cinema?"
"04","12","3","KIRSTEN","So tempting. You're going to be late. You better go."
"04","12","4","KIRSTEN","Oh, hi, it's Kirsten Cohen. I was wondering if Dr. Harris could see me; it's urgent."
"04","12","5","SETH","Are you sure it's all right to leave her? She seems a little down."
"04","12","5","SANDY","Oh, she's turning 40. Even for a woman as beautiful as your mother, that's not easy."
"04","12","5","RYAN","Well, maybe we should stay."
"04","12","5","SANDY","No, trust me. Right now, all she wants is a little time alone to process everything."
"04","12","5","RYAN","You don't think she knows about the party?"
"04","12","5","SANDY","What? No. Are you kidding me? Nobody plans a surprise party like Sandy Cohen. I could've been with the CIA."
"04","12","5","SETH","I hear they're known for their birthday parties."
"04","12","6","SETH","Che, what are you...? I mean, this is real, right? This isn't a dream?"
"04","12","6","SETH","Um... I hate it."
"04","12","6","SETH","I'm glad I don't sleep naked."
"04","12","6","SETH","You could've had..."
"04","12","7","KAITLIN","Okay, you guys, that's gross. I'm supposed to be my mom, okay?"
"04","12","7","KAITLIN","I've been e-mailing Bullit as my mom for, like, a month now. You don't think it'd bea little weird if I randomly asked him about his butt?"
"04","12","7","KAITLIN","Do you guys not realize how much you talk about other guys' butts?"
"04","12","7","KAITLIN","""I miss your butt. Love, Julie."""
"04","12","8","SANDY","Hey. You busy?"
"04","12","8","RYAN","No."
"04","12","8","SANDY","I'm just going in to pick up Kirsten's birthday present. Thought you might want to come along. You know, grab some lunch."
"04","12","8","RYAN","Ah, yeah, sure."
"04","12","8","SANDY","Is everything okay?"
"04","12","8","RYAN","Mm-hmm. Fine."
"04","12","8","SANDY","How are you doing with all that's going on with Taylor?"
"04","12","8","RYAN","Okay."
"04","12","8","SANDY","Are you sure?"
"04","12","8","RYAN","Yeah. Yeah, I mean, she says she needs time. I get it. I got plenty of other things to keep me busy. Sandy, I'm fine. I'm not sitting around missing her if that's what you're asking."
"04","12","8","SANDY","All right. Okay. Let's say half an hour?"
"04","12","8","RYAN","All right."
"04","12","9","TAYLOR","I need help, Doctor."
"04","12","9","TAYLOR","Oh, I read your article about emotional addictions <i>in The Journal of Abstract Thought. I saw you teach at UCI, and it just kind of seemed like fate."
"04","12","9","TAYLOR","Yeah, pretty much all my life. 'Cause I never really knew my dad and my mom is... kind of like Idi Amin with fake boobs. You know, big on the torturing and the tyranny, not so big on the nurturing."
"04","12","9","TAYLOR","And then from there, I just kind of became this person who whenever anybody would hold out, like, the slightest prospect of emotional support, I would just seize on it. Like, I married a man who I knew for two weeks just because he told me he loved me."
"04","12","9","TAYLOR","Well, I'm dating this guy, Ryan And he's just really wonderful and... I really care about him a lot, but I told him that I needed some space because..."
"04","12","9","TAYLOR","Yes. Exactly."
"04","12","9","TAYLOR","This time apart? Well, that's kind of the other problem. sometimes, when I like someone, I... sometimes... kind of, uh, stalk them. Not in like a scary Star 80 way. Just to, you know, like, follow them around and take pictures and log their activities and then compile it all in a factually accurate, yet aesthetically pleasing scrapbook, and it's all really very... Oh, my God, I'm a total lunatic."
"04","12","9","TAYLOR","I do. I really, really do."
"04","12","9","TAYLOR","Okay. I'm in your hands, Doctor."
"04","12","10","KAITLIN","What are you doing?"
"04","12","10","JULIE","Neil and I bought these in Cabo. I'm selling them."
"04","12","10","KAITLIN","Why?"
"04","12","10","JULIE","Because times are tough, Kaitlin."
"04","12","10","KAITLIN","Well, do I need to remind you that your boyfriend's a billionaire?"
"04","12","10","JULIE","No, he's not. I mean... Are you cheating on Bullit? No, I'm not even dating him. That fizzled when he went to Dubai."
"04","12","10","KAITLIN","Oh. Well, he thinks you guys are still dating."
"04","12","10","JULIE","Have you been talking to him?"
"04","12","10","KAITLIN","No. Just a couple e-mails. And what have you told him?"
"04","12","10","JULIE","Nothing."
"04","12","10","KAITLIN","Just... I know he really likes you. And I know he thinks you guys are still a couple. But wait, are you seeing anyone else?"
"04","12","10","JULIE","That's none of your business."
"04","12","10","KAITLIN","Fine. Okay, well, what are you going to tell the Bullit? 'Cause he comes back today."
"04","12","10","JULIE","Will you please answer that?"
"04","12","11","KAITLIN","Um... yeah. Thank you. ""Can't wait till tomorrow night. Miss you already."""
"04","12","12","KAITLIN","Not a drop."
"04","12","12","KIRSTEN","No. I mean, not more than usual."
"04","12","12","KIRSTEN","Thanks."
"04","12","13","SETH","You're crazy."
"04","12","13","SETH","I thought you wanted to release turtles into the ocean or something. I'm not going to help you steal Newport Chuck."
"04","12","13","SETH","I don't know, he seems to be doing all right with the free carrot deal."
"04","12","13","SETH","Oh, God. Fine. Okay."
"04","12","13","SETH","You know, you helped me heal my inner otter, I owe you. You mean, you want to help?"
"04","12","13","SETH","...I feel we have a bond. So what's the plan?"
"04","12","14","GORDON","Hey, Peanut. I just left the airport."
"04","12","14","KAITLIN","We need to talk."
"04","12","14","GORDON","Not if it's about that duty-free booze you asked me to buy."
"04","12","14","KAITLIN","No, it's definitely not about that. There's a little something that I should talk to you about."
"04","12","14","GORDON","Okay, then why don't you meet me at the jewelry store."
"04","12","14","KAITLIN","What are you talking about?"
"04","12","14","GORDON","Well, Squirt, I liked your mother before I left, but these e-mails I've been getting lately, especially the last one... let's just say, I like the way her mind works. Yes, she is the girl for me."
"04","12","14","KAITLIN","You're going to ask her to marry you? Oh, damn am."
"04","12","14","GORDON","Why? What were you going to tell me?"
"04","12","14","KAITLIN","Nothing. She loves anything that's an emerald cut."
"04","12","14","GORDON","So you're saying I should ask her?"
"04","12","14","KAITLIN","Yeah, absolutely. You should totally ask her. Totally."
"04","12","15","SUMMER","You saved a valet ticket?"
"04","12","15","TAYLOR","Oh, yeah, that's from our third date. He's a very generous tipper. You wouldn't know it to look at him."
"04","12","15","SUMMER","What's this?"
"04","12","15","TAYLOR","Toothpick."
"04","12","15","SUMMER","Gross."
"04","12","15","TAYLOR","Well, he didn't use it... much."
"04","12","15","SUMMER","Okay, Taylor... although I wholeheartedly support you getting rid of everything in this box for purely sanitary reasons, If you like Ryan and he likes you, screw the therapist and figure out your stuff together. I mean, all of this just seems a little insane."
"04","12","15","TAYLOR","Summer, my whole life I've been completely powerless before people who say they have feelings for me. I feel like I need to do this for myself as much as for me and Ryan."
"04","12","15","SUMMER","Even if you lose him?"
"04","12","15","TAYLOR","If I don't do this, I'm going to lose him anyway. I don't have a choice."
"04","12","15","SUMMER","Okay. Well, I hope you know what you're doing."
"04","12","15","TAYLOR","Yeah. Me, too."
"04","12","16","RYAN","Kaitlin."
"04","12","16","KAITLIN","Ryan. Hi."
"04","12","16","RYAN","Hey. You buying some jewelry?"
"04","12","16","KAITLIN","Yeah, just buying some class rings."
"04","12","16","RYAN","Are you here with someone?"
"04","12","16","KAITLIN","No. Are you?"
"04","12","16","RYAN","Yeah, Sandy's buying part of Kirsten's birthday present. Hey, how's Taylor been?"
"04","12","16","KAITLIN","Well... weird."
"04","12","16","RYAN","Weird like...?"
"04","12","16","KAITLIN","Weirder than normal."
"04","12","16","RYAN","Really?"
"04","12","16","KAITLIN","Yeah. A little bit. Hi, Mr. Cohen."
"04","12","16","SANDY","Kaitlin, you coming to the party tomorrow?"
"04","12","16","KAITLIN","Um, yeah, totally. Listen, I got to go, but I'll see you guys."
"04","12","16","RYAN","Everything okay?"
"04","12","16","SANDY","No. The guy in Carson. I just got a message. He lost it."
"04","12","16","RYAN","He lost it?"
"04","12","16","SANDY","Yeah. I don't know how you do that."
"04","12","17","GORDON","The hell you hiding from?"
"04","12","17","KAITLIN","You scared me."
"04","12","17","GORDON","Well, quit hiding out in the shadows like some Al Quaeda wacko."
"04","12","17","KAITLIN","I just thought I saw my mom. So what'd you end up getting?"
"04","12","17","GORDON","Yeah, I did. How you like that?"
"04","12","17","KAITLIN","Wow. Is it the most expensive one?"
"04","12","17","GORDON","Well, Bullit bought it. Of course it is. And your mama deserves it."
"04","12","17","KAITLIN","Good. All right. Now let's talk about that proposal."
"04","12","17","GORDON","No, I got it worked out. This Iranian fellow on my flight played me this Persian love song on his cell phone. So I downloaded it. Check that out."
"04","12","17","KAITLIN","Mm-hmm, let's definitely talk about that proposal."
"04","12","17","GORDON","It's gonna work."
"04","12","18","SETH","But the door is locked."
"04","12","18","SETH","How is that tour by the way? I've always wondered."
"04","12","18","SETH","Oh, great. How do we get on the roof?"
"04","12","18","SETH","I've never climbed."
"04","12","19","SETH","I actually heard he was captured in Irvine, but just one thing..."
"04","12","19","SETH","You know this plan is insane, right? It'll never work."
"04","12","19","SETH","Oh, great."
"04","12","19","SETH","I like... my favorite flavor is cherry, but my dad's is blueberry."
"04","12","20","RYAN","Hi."
"04","12","20","RYAN","Yeah. Can I help you?"
"04","12","20","RYAN","O... kay. Excuse me. Wait. Who are you?"
"04","12","20","RYAN","So you're her therapist."
"04","12","20","RYAN","And she gave you... Is she in your car?"
"04","12","20","RYAN","Taylor, what is this? What's going on?"
"04","12","20","RYAN","Uh, okay, but she's right here. Taylor. Taylor."
"04","12","20","RYAN","Can you just please tell him that I'm sorry, but I really think this is what's best for me and us?"
"04","12","20","RYAN","Yeah, I heard that. Taylor, would you talk to me, please? This is crazy. All right, would you at least tell me what this is about? Are you breaking up with me?"
"04","12","20","RYAN","Taylor, look, whatever the reason you're doing all this, you don't have to-- we can work on it together. Please. Please."
"04","12","20","TAYLOR","Good-bye, Ryan."
"04","12","20","RYAN","Does that mean... Okay, you're gonna..."
"04","12","21","SETH","Hey, little buddy. Che. Che. What was wrong with the elevator?"
"04","12","21","SETH","What was that?"
"04","12","21","SETH","Okay, where are the ropes?"
"04","12","21","SETH","Dude..."
"04","12","21","SETH","Do you want to...?"
"04","12","21","SETH","Hey. There some sort of problem?"
"04","12","21","SETH","So are you saying we're stuck up here?"
"04","12","22","SETH","Che, what are you doing?"
"04","12","22","SETH","So?"
"04","12","22","SETH","You'll be going on your little adventures by yourself from now on?"
"04","12","23","SANDY","Oh! Happy birthday, sweetheart."
"04","12","23","KIRSTEN","Thanks."
"04","12","23","SANDY","Hey. Come on. Sit down. I am making you a birthday breakfast you won't believe."
"04","12","23","KIRSTEN","Oh, that's sweet, but, Sandy, I don't think I'm in the mood for a big breakfast."
"04","12","23","SANDY","Oh, you're taking this turning-40 thing a little hard, aren't you? You know, it's not the end of the world. You're more beautiful now than the day we met. Soon, Seth and Ryan'll be gone. We'll be able to do whatever we want. We'll be like kids again."
"04","12","23","KIRSTEN","And live in the back of a mail truck?"
"04","12","23","SANDY","Why not? 'Course, maybe we'll throw in a pillow-top mattress. My back's not what it used to be."
"04","12","23","KIRSTEN","Sandy..."
"04","12","23","RYAN","Hey! Happy birthday."
"04","12","23","KIRSTEN","Oh... Hey, thanks."
"04","12","23","RYAN","Did I interrupt something?"
"04","12","23","KIRSTEN","No!"
"04","12","23","RYAN","Okay."
"04","12","23","KIRSTEN","Oh. Excuse me."
"04","12","23","RYAN","Any luck yet?"
"04","12","23","SANDY","Nothing. I must've made 30 calls yesterday."
"04","12","23","RYAN","All right. Well, anything you need me to do today, I'm all yours."
"04","12","23","SANDY","Thanks. I feel she really needs this."
"04","12","24","KIRSTEN","Of course I can see the doctor today, but can't she just tell me? I understand. She wants to tell me in person."
"04","12","25","JULIE","Hi, babe."
"04","12","25","KAITLIN","Mom, where are you?"
"04","12","25","JULIE","I'm at the spa getting shined and buffed. What's up?"
"04","12","25","KAITLIN","What does it feel like when your appendix bursts?"
"04","12","26","TAYLOR","I don't feel proud."
"04","12","26","TAYLOR","Yeah, but the look on his face... I just wanted to hold him."
"04","12","26","TAYLOR","Okay. All right. Oh, God, I'm sorry. Sorry about that."
"04","12","27","JULIE","Kaitlin?"
"04","12","27","KAITLIN","Mom, I'm fine."
"04","12","27","JULIE","What? Wh...? What are all these flowers doing here?"
"04","12","27","KAITLIN","There's someone who wants to ask you something."
"04","12","27","JULIE","What are you talking about?"
"04","12","27","GORDON","There you are."
"04","12","27","JULIE","Gordon!?"
"04","12","27","GORDON","You are a sight for sore eyes. Come to Big Daddy."
"04","12","27","JULIE","Okay, everybody stop. What is going on? You're not dying and... Gordon, what are you doing here?"
"04","12","27","GORDON","It's time, squirt. Hit it."
"04","12","27","KAITLIN","I really don't think that it's..."
"04","12","27","GORDON","Trust me. Hit it."
"04","12","27","KAITLIN","Okay."
"04","12","27","JULIE","Oh. My God."
"04","12","27","GORDON","Julie Cooper, I've traveled the world over, had everything money can buy, but there comes a time in a billionaire's life that his money ain't worth a dime unless he has someone to share it with. Will you marry me?"
"04","12","27","JULIE","I don't know what to say."
"04","12","27","GORDON","Oh, a ""yes"" works for me."
"04","12","27","KAITLIN","Mom, isn't this great?"
"04","12","27","JULIE","Y... I-it's very, very nice, but, please, stand up. I'm, I'm flattered, but... w-will you turn that off, please?"
"04","12","27","KAITLIN","Okay."
"04","12","27","JULIE","Fine. Thank you. I guess I'm just surprised."
"04","12","27","GORDON","Well, when I see something I want, I go for it like a bullet. Bang."
"04","12","27","JULIE","But, Gordon, we haven't spoken since you went to Dubai."
"04","12","27","KAITLIN","Mom, he just asked you to marry him. I mean... look at the ring. It's ri-dog-ulous."
"04","12","27","GORDON","An-and what about all those e-mails? I've never seen so many X's and O's and that would be hugs and kisses, right?"
"04","12","27","JULIE","W-what e-mails?"
"04","12","27","KAITLIN","You know, the music was actually really awesome."
"04","12","27","GORDON","And especially that last one-- you know the one, where you said..."
"04","12","27","KAITLIN","Oh, crap."
"04","12","28","SUMMER","Hello."
"04","12","28","SUMMER","Che, oh, my God, he looks so sad."
"04","12","28","SUMMER","Newport Chuck. I'm looking at him right now-- I thought you were going to rescue him."
"04","12","28","SUMMER","Yeah. They're setting up for the ceremony right now. Where are you?"
"04","12","28","SUMMER","What? You're in jail, Che?"
"04","12","28","SUMMER","No. Che, I told you not to involve me."
"04","12","28","SUMMER","All right. I'll see what I can do."
"04","12","29","TAYLOR","I see. So, who else is on stage other than the mayor and, obviously, Newport Chuck?"
"04","12","29","TAYLOR","And so, uh, that's it?"
"04","12","29","TAYLOR","Uh... Groundhog's Day Weekly. which comes out once a year, usually around..."
"04","12","29","TAYLOR","Yes. Thank you so much."
"04","12","30","JULIE","You were e-mailing him and pretending to be me?"
"04","12","30","KAITLIN","I just know you don't deal well with long-distance relationships. I thought you might regret it."
"04","12","30","JULIE","Really? That's the reason? Has nothing to do with you being sick of eating frozen dinners?"
"04","12","30","KAITLIN","What? And your saying no has nothing to do with the fact you're seeing a mystery man?"
"04","12","30","JULIE","A.) I never said no. B.) That is my private life. Kaitlin, there is more to relationships than just money. I don't care for The Bullit just because he's a billionaire."
"04","12","30","KAITLIN","Maybe I care a little bit. But the reason why I would've told him to marry you is because I know he loves you, and he's a really nice guy, and he's really funny...and he'd make an amazing step-dad."
"04","12","30","JULIE","You have to tell him the truth."
"04","12","30","KAITLIN","What are you gonna tell him?"
"04","12","30","JULIE","I don't know."
"04","12","30","KAITLIN","Well, better make up your mind quick...'cause I'm taking him with me to Kirsten's party."
"04","12","31","KIRSTEN","Hello."
"04","12","31","JULIE","Kirsten. I need your help. Oh. Happy birthday."
"04","12","31","KIRSTEN","Thanks."
"04","12","31","JULIE","Bullit just proposed to me."
"04","12","31","KIRSTEN","That's nice."
"04","12","31","JULIE","I told him I'd give him an answer by tonight, but the truth is...I've been seeing someone else in secret. You'll never believe who."
"04","12","31","KIRSTEN","Julie, I'm, I'm gonna lie down. Congratulations."
"04","12","32","SANDY","That was a guy at the junkyard at Chatsworth. He's got one. He says he can have it at the yacht club in an hour."
"04","12","32","RYAN","Sounds like everything's gonna be okay."
"04","12","32","SANDY","Well, let's hope. What's going on with you and Taylor? Come on. You've been in the dumps today."
"04","12","32","RYAN","Honestly, I don't know. She said she needs space; I said, ""Sure."""
"04","12","32","TAYLOR","Stupid tree. Oh... dumb branches."
"04","12","32","RYAN","I sort of talked to her."
"04","12","32","SANDY","Taylor was right there, right?"
"04","12","32","RYAN","Oh, yeah, oh, yeah; but she wasn't supposed to be talking to me. She would say something and then the therapist would say it again to me. Wow. It's crazy, huh?"
"04","12","32","SANDY","Yeah. I mean, a little, but..."
"04","12","32","RYAN","And, I mean, I want her to do what she needs to do."
"04","12","32","SANDY","Did you tell her that?"
"04","12","32","RYAN","I tried."
"04","12","32","SANDY","Excuse me."
"04","12","32","RYAN","Yeah, sure."
"04","12","32","SANDY","Yeah, hello. Seth? Where are you?"
"04","12","32","TAYLOR","Oh, no..."
"04","12","32","RYAN","Oh, whoa, you... You okay? Taylor? What are you doing?"
"04","12","32","TAYLOR","I was just..."
"04","12","32","RYAN","Taylor, are you okay?"
"04","12","32","TAYLOR","I'm sorry. Just... forget you ever knew me."
"04","12","33","SETH","My dad said he'll be right over."
"04","12","33","SETH","Don't worry, Dale. He knows you're here, too."
"04","12","33","SETH","Mm-hmm."
"04","12","33","SETH","Oh... that's awesome; frogs are cool."
"04","12","33","SETH","What? Wha-What wasn't an otter?"
"04","12","33","SETH","You were gonna say... Che!"
"04","12","33","SETH","Che, what wasn't an otter?"
"04","12","33","SETH","That's great."
"04","12","33","SETH","You coming?"
"04","12","33","SETH","Works for me."
"04","12","34","KIRSTEN","Sandy, where have you been? I called you three times."
"04","12","34","SANDY","Well, it's been a busy afternoon."
"04","12","34","KIRSTEN","Please tell me that you haven't planned anything big tonight."
"04","12","34","SANDY","Well, on your birthday, sorry, but I plead the Fifth. Listen, can you meet me at the yacht club?"
"04","12","34","KIRSTEN","I thought we were going together."
"04","12","34","SANDY","Yeah, I know, but I had to make other arrangements."
"04","12","34","KIRSTEN","Sandy..."
"04","12","34","SANDY","I'll see you in a few minutes."
"04","12","35","SETH","Hi, Dad. I hope I'm not late for Mom's party."
"04","12","36","KIRSTEN","Yes?"
"04","12","37","RYAN","I cannot believe that you tried to steal Newport Chuck."
"04","12","37","SETH","Sometimes the universe makes you do things that you don't even understand."
"04","12","37","RYAN","Sure. Well, Sandy didn't seem to upset about it."
"04","12","37","SETH","Are you kidding? He's waited 18 years for me to be arrested for political activism. It's probably the proudest moment of his entire life."
"04","12","37","RYAN","Ah! It's your mom. Good evening."
"04","12","37","KIRSTEN","Good evening. Thank you."
"04","12","37","RYAN","You're welcome."
"04","12","37","SETH","Happy birthday."
"04","12","37","KIRSTEN","Oh, thank you. I hope your father didn't do anything too extravagant."
"04","12","37","RYAN","Ooh, might be a little late for that, yeah."
"04","12","37","KIRSTEN","Oh, my God."
"04","12","37","RYAN","Yeah, that was my first thought, too."
"04","12","37","SANDY","Happy birthday, sweetheart."
"04","12","37","KIRSTEN","Oh... Sandy, it's..."
"04","12","37","SANDY","No, it's not the same mail truck we had at Berkeley, but it is exactly the same model."
"04","12","37","KIRSTEN","It's amazing. Thank you."
"04","12","37","SANDY","And here's your real present. Happy birthday. Around-the-world first-class air tickets. Just you and me. That's not bad, huh?"
"04","12","37","KIRSTEN","Ah... I-I think I can... I can top it. Can I talk to you in private?"
"04","12","37","SANDY","Yeah."
"04","12","37","KIRSTEN","You two stay here."
"04","12","37","SANDY","Fellas, watch the truck."
"04","12","38","KIRSTEN","I want you seated for this."
"04","12","38","SANDY","Is everything okay?"
"04","12","38","KIRSTEN","I went to a doctor."
"04","12","38","SANDY","Are you sick?"
"04","12","38","KIRSTEN","Yes. But only in the mornings."
"04","12","38","SANDY","What?"
"04","12","38","KIRSTEN","I'm pregnant."
"04","12","38","SANDY","Wait, one more time."
"04","12","38","KIRSTEN","Sandy, we're having a baby."
"04","12","38","SANDY","We're having a baby?!"
"04","12","38","KIRSTEN","Everything's gonna change."
"04","12","38","SANDY","You're not kidding. I love you."
"04","12","38","KIRSTEN","Well, that's good, because there's gonna be a lot more of me to love."
"04","12","38","SANDY","Oh, my gosh."
"04","12","39","KAITLIN","And then Brad was, like, ""Oh, no,"" and I was, like, ""Oh, yeah."""
"04","12","39","GORDON","Well, that Brad sounds like a piece of work. And I still can't believe you wrote me all those e-mails."
"04","12","39","KAITLIN","Yeah, I'm sorry about that."
"04","12","39","GORDON","And that last one, a little frisky, a little inappropriate. Aw, but what the hell. The offer still stands she's still the most exciting woman I've ever met."
"04","12","39","JULIE","Kaitlin. Gordon."
"04","12","39","KAITLIN","Mom, did you hear that? The Bullit still wants to marry you."
"04","12","39","JULIE","Yes. Well, Gordon, that's very generous. But I'm afraid my answer has to be no. Sit down; I'm not finished. As I was saying, no because we don't know each other well enough. But... I'm willing to correct that. I like you, Gordon, and if after spending time together, I can grow to love you, then... yes, I would be proud to be your wife."
"04","12","39","GORDON","Wow. Oh, wow. Come here."
"04","12","39","KAITLIN","Can I get up now?"
"04","12","39","JULIE","Yes, of course you can get up."
"04","12","40","SETH","Oh, my God."
"04","12","40","RYAN","Oh, my God."
"04","12","40","SANDY","That's what I said."
"04","12","40","KIRSTEN","I know this isn't what everybody expected."
"04","12","40","SANDY","That's family, there's nothing more important than that. I mean... I mean, you're... you're pregnant."
"04","12","40","SETH","It's so weird."
"04","12","40","RYAN","Yeah, well, congratulations."
"04","12","40","SETH","Yeah, it's great."
"04","12","40","SANDY","Especially since it makes me getting arrested seem trivial now..."
"04","12","40","KIRSTEN","You got what?"
"04","12","40","SETH","Thanks for prepping her, Dad."
"04","12","40","SANDY","Oh, that we'll deal with that later. Uh, right now... we've got some guests inside."
"04","12","40","SETH","Actually, I was gonna ru and pick up Summer, so..."
"04","12","40","RYAN","Oh, could you give me a ride, 'cause I got..."
"04","12","40","SETH","Go tell Taylor that you love her and you can't live without her?"
"04","12","40","RYAN","Mm, something like that. Hey, I'll see you guys in a few minutes."
"04","12","40","KIRSTEN","Yeah. And suddenly, we're alone again."
"04","12","40","SANDY","Eh, not for long."
"04","12","41","SUMMER","Take care of him."
"04","12","41","SUMMER","It's okay-- turns out the mayor's a lover of our animal brethren. He gave us both amnesty."
"04","12","41","SUMMER","So your dream was right all along-- that's amazing!"
"04","12","41","SETH","Hey. Wow, crowded room. You guys off?"
"04","12","41","SETH","You mean Chicago or something?"
"04","12","41","SUMMER","So, are we too late for your mom's birthday party?"
"04","12","41","SETH","Uh, actually, I think it may be more of a baby shower now, but I'll explain in the car, or maybe I won't. I think it's supposed to be a secret. Listen, what did, uh, Che mean when he said ""in another life""? In another life what?"
"04","12","42","TAYLOR","Hello? Hello?"
"04","12","42","RYAN","Oh, yeah..."
"04","12","42","TAYLOR","Who is this?"
"04","12","42","RYAN","What are you wearing?"
"04","12","42","TAYLOR","Ryan? Were you just trying to stalk me?"
"04","12","42","RYAN","Yeah, I guess I need a little more practice."
"04","12","42","TAYLOR","That is the most romantic thing anyone has ever done for me."
"04","12","42","RYAN","So does that mean the whole, uh, space thing..."
"04","12","42","TAYLOR","Yeah, terrible idea. You don't mind dating someone who's a total weirdo?"
"04","12","42","RYAN","No, no. In fact, I was thinking we could work around it. Like, I have to go to Kirsten's party, but if you wanted... you could follow me."
"04","12","42","TAYLOR","Yes, and then when we get there, I could hide behind a plant and just kind of watch you."
"04","12","42","RYAN","Exactly, exactly. And then, on the way home, I could stalk you."
"04","12","42","TAYLOR","Yes! And then I stalk you."
"04","12","43","JULIE","Hi. It's me. No, I-I won't be making it tonight. Listen, I, uh... I'm back with Bullit. I know. I know. But this is the best thing for my family. I'm sorry."
"04","12","43","FRANK","Me, too."
"04","12","43","JULIE","Good-bye, Frank."
"04","13","0","TAYLOR","Really? Nothing?"
"04","13","0","RYAN","It may not sound like a good idea. It's not a good idea."
"04","13","0","TAYLOR","We're dating. We just got back together, in fact, and you're proposing that for Valentine's Day we do nothing."
"04","13","0","RYAN","No, no. We don't have to spend the night apart. We could just hang out. Uh, see a movie."
"04","13","0","TAYLOR","Oh, God, stop. My head is spinning from all of the romance."
"04","13","0","RYAN","Taylor,this holiday, us, it's a recipe for disaster."
"04","13","0","TAYLOR","Why? 'Cause I'm needy?"
"04","13","0","RYAN","'Cause I've on occasion been known to stalk you?"
"04","13","0","TAYLOR","There's me, too."
"04","13","0","RYAN","I'm distant and unemotional."
"04","13","0","TAYLOR","And preoccupied. Could we add that to the list? 'Cause it just seems like lately your mind is someplace else."
"04","13","0","RYAN","Taylor. There's no hidden meaning here. I just feel if we don't put too much pressure on this holiday, we might actually get through it."
"04","13","0","TAYLOR","So I shouldn't worry?"
"04","13","0","RYAN","No."
"04","13","0","TAYLOR","Not even when I find a suspicious address by your bed? I looked at it when you were in the bathroom. Sorry."
"04","13","0","RYAN","It's nothing. It's an address.Not the address of some other girl if that's what you're thinking. Look, um, I got to get to work, but I promise you there's nothing to worry about, okay?"
"04","13","0","TAYLOR","Okay. All right. So we're good?"
"04","13","0","RYAN","Yeah, we're good."
"04","13","0","TAYLOR","All right."
"04","13","1","TAYLOR","Oh."
"04","13","1","FRANK","Taylor, right?"
"04","13","1","TAYLOR","So it's you."
"04","13","2","TAYLOR","I-I don't get it. Ryan hasn't been to see you at all?"
"04","13","2","FRANK","Well, I left a message with him when I,when I switched hotels. I told him I was here in case he wanted to see me, but so far,no luck. Taylor, don't mind me asking... what are you doing here?"
"04","13","2","TAYLOR","Well, I found this address by Ryan's bed and he's been kind of distant lately, so I thought it may be a clue. So I came here and then I... I have emotional problems, but I'm getting over it."
"04","13","2","FRANK","Well, I'm glad Ryan at least kept my address, since, you know, he's not using it."
"04","13","2","TAYLOR","Well, clearly he wants to reach out. Maybe he's just afraid or he doesn't really know how to do it."
"04","13","2","FRANK","Because, you know, I'd love to talk to him, you know?"
"04","13","2","TAYLOR","Apologize again for that cancer stunt."
"04","13","2","FRANK","But I'm scared if I make the first move..."
"04","13","2","TAYLOR","He's going to pull away. Yes, you're absolutely right. I've had a lot of experience with that. Wait a sec. Idea coming in. And here it is, okay. What if I were to get involved? I could help you guys smooth things over, broker the peace talks..."
"04","13","2","FRANK","You-you'd be willing to do that, get in the line of fire?"
"04","13","2","TAYLOR","It's just that there's something kind of, kind of sad about Ryan. Maybe if he was to mend his relationship with you, he could be a little happier."
"04","13","2","FRANK","Well, I am all for it. Do you have a plan in mind?"
"04","13","2","TAYLOR","Always."
"04","13","3","SANDY","Wow, is this a second breakfast or an early lunch?"
"04","13","3","KIRSTEN","It's either one. I was craving French toast, do you want some?"
"04","13","3","SANDY","No, thanks. I'm having flashbacks to when you were pregnant with Seth."
"04","13","3","KIRSTEN","I know, and all I did was eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I made some of my finest sandwiches in that year."
"04","13","3","SANDY","Mm-hmm. I haven't had peanut butter and jelly since. I can't believe we're doing this again. All the times we tried to have another one after Seth."
"04","13","3","KIRSTEN","Well, we did have a second one, it just came later in life."
"04","13","3","SANDY","Ah, the more the merrier."
"04","13","3","KIRSTEN","Oh, I just lost my appetite."
"04","13","3","SANDY","I thought you were starving."
"04","13","3","KIRSTEN","Cravings, up and down like a roller coaster. I'm going to get dressed."
"04","13","4","JULIE","Gordon, it's not Valentine's Day yet."
"04","13","4","GORDON","I don't care, you're my wife, and I'll give you roses anytime I dang well please."
"04","13","4","JULIE","Right. Well, these are certainly beautiful, but um, I think I need to remind you..."
"04","13","4","GORDON","Oh, I know. You haven't given me the green light on that marriage proposal. But I didn't make $900 million by being a pessimist. Did I mention that there will be no pre-nup?"
"04","13","4","JULIE","Well... That is so generous. But before we get on with the rest of our lives..."
"04","13","4","GORDON","Right, Valentine's Day, and I made reservations at the yacht club as per your request. And I did take the liberty of booking us, that's you and me, a suite at the Four Seasons. I mean, here we are,practically man and wife and we still haven't sealed the deal."
"04","13","4","JULIE","I guess I'm just old-fashioned that way."
"04","13","4","GORDON","Well, if I do say so myself, you're in for quite a treat."
"04","13","4","JULIE","Can we just not talk about it?"
"04","13","4","GORDON","Well, I can sum it up in one word."
"04","13","4","JULIE","Don't."
"04","13","4","GORDON","Bang."
"04","13","4","JULIE","Yeah."
"04","13","4","GORDON","Oh, sorry, gorgeous. I'm just a sucker for that pun. But seriously now. I can't wait to take you down to Chinatown."
"04","13","4","JULIE","Right. Me, too. Kaitlin, baby, hi."
"04","13","4","KAITLIN","Hi. What's up, nerd?"
"04","13","4","GORDON","Wow, who you calling nerd, bird legs?"
"04","13","4","KAITLIN","You, nerd."
"04","13","4","GORDON","Okay, squirt, you up for some ping-pong? You ready to get your ass kicked?"
"04","13","4","KAITLIN","In your dreams."
"04","13","4","JULIE","You two play ping-pong?"
"04","13","4","GORDON","Oh, yeah. We got a table at the office and Peanut is getting pretty good."
"04","13","4","KAITLIN","You think that's lame?"
"04","13","4","JULIE","No, it's, it's... It's like totally normal."
"04","13","4","KAITLIN","Mom, it's just ping-pong. There's no reason to get emotional about it. Can I drive the Ferrari?"
"04","13","4","GORDON","No. Oh, what the hell? Get her purring, I'll be there in a second."
"04","13","4","JULIE","You're really good with her, you know that?"
"04","13","4","GORDON","Well, she's like her mom. She's a special gal and a real kick in the pants. Bye, sweetie."
"04","13","5","SUMMER","If the sea otters disappear completely, then the entire aquatic ecosystem will be disrupted."
"04","13","5","SETH","I know. We need the sea otters to eat the sea urchins, otherwise there'd be a sea urchin population explosion, causing some catastrophe involving the kelp forests."
"04","13","5","SUMMER","I guess you're pretty sick of me talking about otters."
"04","13","5","SETH","Not at all. If I have to share you, I'm glad it can be with otters."
"04","13","5","SUMMER","Well, did you know that my Web site got over 8,000 hits yesterday? And I'm going to have a video conference with someone from Greenpeace maybe next week."
"04","13","5","SETH","Wow, I hope you can squeeze me in for Valentine's Day."
"04","13","5","SUMMER","Valentine's Day?"
"04","13","5","SETH","Yeah, it's in two days. You forgot, didn't you?"
"04","13","5","SUMMER","No, of course not. Here's a psychic, come on."
"04","13","5","SETH","Do we have to?"
"04","13","5","SUMMER","Yes."
"04","13","5","SETH","Not bad. You'll go there next year to study art. You'll do well."
"04","13","5","SUMMER","Huh. You're really good, psychic lady. Do me."
"04","13","5","SUMMER","Falling objects?"
"04","13","5","SUMMER","Oh, good, okay, thank you for your time."
"04","13","5","SUMMER","Me, too."
"04","13","5","SETH","Let me give you a little help. Seth."
"04","13","5","SETH","Seth."
"04","13","5","SETH","George?"
"04","13","5","SUMMER","George?"
"04","13","5","SETH","You're leaving me for a guy named George?"
"04","13","5","SUMMER","No."
"04","13","5","SUMMER","Okay, um, Seth why don't you go get me some ice cream?"
"04","13","5","SETH","Okay."
"04","13","5","SUMMER","All right, listen, psychic lady. My boyfriend, his name is Seth and if anyone's my destiny, it's him, so will you please stop it with all this George stuff?"
"04","13","5","SETH","What was that?"
"04","13","5","SUMMER","Destiny?"
"04","13","6","RYAN","So this has nothing to do with Valentine's Day?"
"04","13","6","TAYLOR","No, why would you think that?"
"04","13","6","RYAN","Hmm, I don't know, you, me, romantic dinner, you have some sort of surprise."
"04","13","6","FRANK","Hi, Ryan."
"04","13","6","RYAN","Hey. Can I talk to you for a minute? Would you excuse us?"
"04","13","6","FRANK","No problem."
"04","13","6","RYAN","Thanks."
"04","13","6","TAYLOR","At least it wasn't a romantic surprise."
"04","13","6","RYAN","The note by my bed."
"04","13","6","TAYLOR","Yeah, I found it, I went there and I found your dad. And I don't know, I thought maybe you were trying to reconnect with him."
"04","13","6","RYAN","Taylor, it's my business."
"04","13","6","TAYLOR","I know, I'm a meddler. But don't worry, once I lick my stalking addiction,that's next on the list. But admit it, you can't tell me you haven't been thinking about him, right? Ryan, come on, it's just dinner."
"04","13","6","RYAN","Yeah, what are we going to talk about? I've never met an awkward silence that I couldn't fill."
"04","13","6","TAYLOR","Consider it your Valentine's gift to me. Oh, not that we're celebrating."
"04","13","6","RYAN","Yeah, I knew I was going to pay for that."
"04","13","6","TAYLOR","Ryan, he's your dad."
"04","13","6","RYAN","Yeah, yeah, one dinner."
"04","13","6","TAYLOR","Okay."
"04","13","6","RYAN","Join us."
"04","13","6","FRANK","She gets her way, doesn't she?"
"04","13","6","RYAN","The woman's a bulldozer."
"04","13","7","KIRSTEN","So famous couples through time?"
"04","13","7","SUMMER","Yeah, you know, Romeo and Juliet, Fred and Wilma, Sandy and Kirsten Cohen. Do you think that's a good idea for a collage?"
"04","13","7","KIRSTEN","Seth's going to love it. And I'm very flattered that Sandy and I made the cut. Oh. Whoa. I have not looked at these for a long time."
"04","13","7","SUMMER","Gosh, check out that permage."
"04","13","7","KIRSTEN","Top Gun had just come out. I wasn't thinking clearly."
"04","13","7","SUMMER","I guess not. Is that you and Jimmy Cooper? Holy guac."
"04","13","7","KIRSTEN","Yeah, that's us at a sweatshirt party. And here we are at the prom."
"04","13","7","SUMMER","Oh, Seth and I have the same picture. Did you ever think that Jimmy was the one?"
"04","13","7","KIRSTEN","Well, we had planned our lives together. He was going to work for my father and I was going to throw fabulous dinner parties. We even had names for our kids."
"04","13","7","SUMMER","Then you broke up."
"04","13","7","KIRSTEN","We grew up. I loved Jimmy a lot when I was your age. But I changed. So will you."
"04","13","7","SUMMER","When you met Sandy how did you know that he was the one?"
"04","13","7","KIRSTEN","I'd never imagined myself with someone like Sandy. But it just felt right. Summer... If you're meant to be with Seth, it'll happen. You just have to be patient."
"04","13","7","SUMMER","I'm not very good at that."
"04","13","7","KIRSTEN","No one is."
"04","13","8","FRANK","So, nothing? Really?"
"04","13","8","TAYLOR","No. Frank, Ryan thinks it would be better for our relationship if we didn't celebrate Valentine's Day at all. It's counterintuitive, I know."
"04","13","8","FRANK","How's that plan working out for you?"
"04","13","8","RYAN","Not great."
"04","13","8","TAYLOR","So Frank, how about you? Speaking of romance... you're single, you're ruggedly handsome. Did you start up any romances with ladies in Newport?"
"04","13","8","FRANK","Well, no. You know, not really."
"04","13","8","TAYLOR","Oh, my God, Frank, you're in love."
"04","13","8","FRANK","Love? I am not."
"04","13","8","TAYLOR","Yes, you are. It's all over your face. Your lips are quivering, your cheeks are rosy."
"04","13","8","RYAN","Yeah, your cheeks are kind of red."
"04","13","8","GORDON","Well, what the hell? Frank Atwood, how are you, bud?"
"04","13","8","FRANK","I'm good, how are you, Bullit?"
"04","13","8","GORDON","Uh, confused, that's how. I thought when you quit the Bullit business you were going to high tail it up to Reno."
"04","13","8","FRANK","Yeah, well, I just stayed a little longer. I wanted to spend some time with my son."
"04","13","8","GORDON","This is your son?"
"04","13","8","RYAN","Yeah."
"04","13","8","GORDON","Well, well, that's great. Oh... here comes the little lady. Every ten seconds she's in the john painting her face, not that I'm complaining. A number that hot, I don't ask questions."
"04","13","8","JULIE","Hey, Taylor, Ryan."
"04","13","8","RYAN","Hi."
"04","13","8","JULIE","Frank."
"04","13","8","FRANK","Julie."
"04","13","8","JULIE","I thought you were leaving town."
"04","13","8","FRANK","I was... am. I'll be gone soon enough."
"04","13","8","GORDON","Oh, Frank is third-wheeling on a date with his son."
"04","13","8","JULIE","Well, we should get to our table. I am starving."
"04","13","8","FRANK","Yeah, and this one can eat. And if you ask me, it goes to all the right places."
"04","13","8","JULIE","Gordon, please. Well, enjoy your dinner. Good-bye, Frank."
"04","13","8","GORDON","Uh, later."
"04","13","8","FRANK","So should we get that check?"
"04","13","8","TAYLOR","Oh, my God, Frank."
"04","13","8","RYAN","Yeah."
"04","13","8","FRANK","What?"
"04","13","8","TAYLOR","Are you in love with Julie Cooper?"
"04","13","9","TAYLOR","Your dad and Julie Cooper. It's just so..."
"04","13","9","RYAN","Incestuous, inappropriate."
"04","13","9","TAYLOR","Well, look at you being all hyper articulate. No, I was going to say it's romantic."
"04","13","9","RYAN","How is it romantic? It's over, she's with somebody else."
"04","13","9","TAYLOR","Who she doesn't really love."
"04","13","9","RYAN","Well, maybe she shouldn't marry Bullit-- doesn't mean she should be with my dad."
"04","13","9","TAYLOR","What if they're meant for each other? If we could at least help them get together, then they could have a chance."
"04","13","9","RYAN","Taylor, I remember what he was like, how he treated my mom and us."
"04","13","9","TAYLOR","Ryan. You have customers. Hola, Luis."
"04","13","9","RYAN","I'll be right there. I know Julie isn't perfect, but I also know my dad. She deserves better."
"04","13","9","TAYLOR","Exactly."
"04","13","10","JIMMY","Go Trojans!"
"04","13","10","KIRSTEN","Oh, Taryn, we wish you were coming, too."
"04","13","10","JIMMY","Don't listen to her."
"04","13","10","KIRSTEN","Sometimes I feel like I'm going to be listening to her snide comments for the rest of my life."
"04","13","10","JIMMY","Next year at this time, we're going to have a whole new life."
"04","13","10","KIRSTEN","Without my dad."
"04","13","10","JIMMY","Without Taryn, just us... always."
"04","13","11","KIRSTEN","Great."
"04","13","11","SANDY","What are you looking at?"
"04","13","11","KIRSTEN","Oh, just baby pictures of Seth. I was feeling very nostalgic."
"04","13","11","SANDY","Oh, who could blame you? He was a cute kid."
"04","13","11","KIRSTEN","I should get ready, I have a work lunch."
"04","13","12","RYAN","Dude, it's a psychic."
"04","13","12","SETH","I know. And Summer says she's not worried, but I can tell she is, which is why I dug into the archives, and came up with evidence that we are, in fact, destined to be together."
"04","13","12","RYAN","It's a piece of loose-leaf, crumpled."
"04","13","12","SETH","I dug it out of a trash can nine years ago."
"04","13","12","RYAN","Okay, explain that."
"04","13","12","SETH","This, my friend, marks the first moment that I fell in love with Summer Roberts. It was the spring... 1998."
"04","13","12","RYAN","Is this a long flashback? Because my break is almost over."
"04","13","12","SETH","Bear with me. It was the spring, 1998."
"04","13","13","SETH","Hey, Luke... Good news. Only 11 months and six days until The Matrix comes out."
"04","13","13","LUKE","Eat it, nerd brain."
"04","13","13","SUMMER","""I wish I was a mermaid and was friends with all the fish A shiny tail and seashells that would be my wish."""
"04","13","14","SETH","And that is when I knew Summer Roberts was the one. Dude, the flashback did not take that long."
"04","13","15","TAYLOR","Hi, Julie. Or should I say Mrs. Bullit?"
"04","13","15","JULIE","Julie's fine. I'm making smoothies. You want one?"
"04","13","15","TAYLOR","Yeah, sure. So I haven't really talked to you since you got engaged. Congrats all over the place."
"04","13","15","JULIE","Well, thank you, but I'm not exactly engaged. I'm just mulling over Bullit's proposal for a while."
"04","13","15","TAYLOR","What's there to mull? I mean, you're totally in love with him, right? You probably can't stop daydreaming about yourfuture together. And just think, for the rest of your life, you get to be in a bed with Bullit."
"04","13","15","JULIE","Suddenly not in the mood."
"04","13","15","TAYLOR","Night after night, you and Bullit making love into the wee hours. You, exploring his body as it gets older, and older. The skin slackening, you still having to perform your wifely duties."
"04","13","15","JULIE","Taylor, stop."
"04","13","15","TAYLOR","Admit it, Julie, you've got it bad for Frank Atwood."
"04","13","15","JULIE","What?"
"04","13","15","TAYLOR","I saw your face last night. You, Julie Cooper, have a case of the Franks."
"04","13","15","JULIE","Okay, I do... I did, or one time or another may have had a case of the Franks, but for reasons that are both personal and complex, I'm staying with Bullit."
"04","13","15","TAYLOR","Julie, you're different now. You are no longer the woman who can marry for money. You need more."
"04","13","15","JULIE","Taylor, I have a child. I have no job. I don't even own this house. Besides, I don't think Ryan would approve. God knows I've put that kid through enough."
"04","13","15","TAYLOR","Julie, Ryan's only concern is for you. He doesn't think his dad's good enough for you."
"04","13","15","JULIE","Ryan Atwood is worried about me?"
"04","13","15","TAYLOR","Yeah."
"04","13","15","JULIE","How about that."
"04","13","16","SETH","Hey, what are you watching?"
"04","13","16","SUMMER","It's bad. It's really bad. Look. Coming up next, could this young woman be the one to save Newport sea otters?"
"04","13","16","SETH","Summer, you're a hero."
"04","13","16","SUMMER","And guess who's bringing sexy back to Newport? That's right, Justin Timberlake is coming to the Bait Shop. Just how does such a small venue get such big names? Everything the psychic said is coming true. You know, any second I'm just going to get whisked away by some dude named George."
"04","13","16","SETH","Relax."
"04","13","16","SUMMER","Now I know that psychic has a lot of credibility. She works at a kiosk, and she doesn't appear to charge for her services, but I think I am a better judge of whether you and I are destined to be together, than her. And I brought proof."
"04","13","16","SETH","Happy early Valentine's Day, Summer."
"04","13","16","SUMMER","The mermaid poem."
"04","13","16","SETH","That's how I knew, even in fifth grade, that you were the one. That's pretty awesome, huh?"
"04","13","16","SUMMER","Oh, my God."
"04","13","16","SETH","I know."
"04","13","16","SUMMER","I didn't write this."
"04","13","16","SETH","What?"
"04","13","16","SUMMER","I remember that day."
"04","13","17","SUMMER","Okay, Holly, watch this."
"04","13","17","TAYLOR","Hey, Summer, are you finished with your poem?"
"04","13","17","SUMMER","What poem?"
"04","13","17","TAYLOR","The original poem that we're reading out loud. We're going in alphabetical order, and we're on ""R."" I already finished mine, even though I'm a ""T."" I may spend my night doing a polish."
"04","13","17","SUMMER","Give me your poem."
"04","13","17","TAYLOR","Summer, have you no ethics whatsoever?"
"04","13","17","SUMMER","Okay, you can come to my birthday party."
"04","13","17","TAYLOR","Really Okay, here."
"04","13","17","SUMMER","I wish I was a mermaid..."
"04","13","17","SUMMER","I wish I was a mermaid and was friends with all the fish. A shiny tail and seashells, that would be my wish."
"04","13","18","SETH","But this mermaid poem is... it's our roots, it's our mythology."
"04","13","18","SUMMER","What if our mythology is a sham? Something that we invented What if we are each other's Jimmy Cooper?"
"04","13","18","SETH","What?"
"04","13","18","SUMMER","You know, the one before the one. The one that you think is right before you meet your Sandy Cohen?"
"04","13","18","SETH","Wait, are we saying that because Taylor wrote the poem, she's my Sandy Cohen? Because as delicious a twist as that would be, it's not going to happen."
"04","13","18","SUMMER","No. What I'm saying is what if we're not destined to be together? That is your cue, Seth, to say that I am wrong. I'm wrong, right? Cue to say I'm wrong, right?"
"04","13","18","SETH","I don't know anymore."
"04","13","19","RYAN","Julie, we're about to close up."
"04","13","19","JULIE","I just wanted to talk to you. Look, I... I know you told Taylor that you were worried about me being involved with your father."
"04","13","19","RYAN","Nah, that's okay, it's over, so no need to talk about it."
"04","13","19","JULIE","Right. It is over between us."
"04","13","19","RYAN","Good, I'm glad."
"04","13","19","JULIE","But Ryan, I just wanted you to know that... I've been with my fair share of bad guys, and for the record, your dad isn't one of them."
"04","13","20","TAYLOR","Hey."
"04","13","20","RYAN","Hi. So what's the plan?"
"04","13","20","TAYLOR","The Frank and Julie plan?"
"04","13","20","RYAN","Yep."
"04","13","20","TAYLOR","Yay, you're on board!"
"04","13","20","RYAN","I talked to Julie."
"04","13","20","TAYLOR","So did I. Lady has a case of the Franks. But lucky for us it's Valentine's Day tomorrow."
"04","13","20","RYAN","So she'll be going out with Bullit, right?"
"04","13","20","TAYLOR","We'll just get rid of Bullit and then we will get Frank and Julie together for the most romantic night ever. So you come over after work, and in the meantime, I'll start making lists. All right, I'll see you later."
"04","13","20","RYAN","Toodles."
"04","13","20","KAITLIN","'Sup?"
"04","13","20","TAYLOR","Kaitlin, were you... eavesdropping?"
"04","13","20","KAITLIN","Look, my mom loves the Bullit, okay? He's rich and he's funny and it's a total slam dunk."
"04","13","20","TAYLOR","Okay, sweetie, it's a little more complicated than that."
"04","13","20","KAITLIN","Not to me. Listen, Townsend, I'm playing for Team Bullit, okay? And my team, we always win."
"04","13","20","TAYLOR","Well, Ryan and I are playing for Team Frank, and our team always wins."
"04","13","20","KAITLIN","That's funny, because you're going down."
"04","13","20","TAYLOR","Are you threatening us?"
"04","13","20","KAITLIN","Totally. It's war, bitch."
"04","13","21","KIRSTEN","Hi, honey."
"04","13","21","SETH","Whoa. Pancakes? When is this Valentine's Day tradition going to die?"
"04","13","21","KIRSTEN","I'm sorry that I've been babying you lately. I'm just feeling a little motherly."
"04","13","21","SETH","That's okay, I'm feeling a little sulky, so we're a good match."
"04","13","21","KIRSTEN","Summer's going through something, isn't she?"
"04","13","21","SETH","She's wondering if I'm her Sandy Cohen or her Jimmy Cooper."
"04","13","21","KIRSTEN","Well, I hope I didn't worry her. So how about you? Are you okay?"
"04","13","21","SETH","Well, Summer and I have this history, or at least I thought we did. These things that happened to us when we were kids that convinced me we were meant to be together. Now if those things turn out not to be true..."
"04","13","21","KIRSTEN","Seth, how long have you dated Summer?"
"04","13","21","SETH","Uh, February... like a million years."
"04","13","21","KIRSTEN","And in that time, how many things has Summer doneto convince you that she's the girl for you?"
"04","13","21","SETH","A lot."
"04","13","21","KIRSTEN","So I think you should focus on that. The real Summer, and not the one that you worshipped in grade school. You know what I think?"
"04","13","21","SETH","What?"
"04","13","21","KIRSTEN","I think that you found your Sandy Cohen."
"04","13","21","SETH","Aw, aw, me, too. Mm, Mom, why'd you and Jimmy Cooper break up, anyways? It doesn't matter."
"04","13","22","JIMMY","Sorry I'm late. Your dad's working me to the bone."
"04","13","22","KIRSTEN","Not even paying you."
"04","13","22","JIMMY","That's an internship for you. He'll make it up to meafter college when I sign my life away to the Newport Group."
"04","13","22","KIRSTEN","Jimmy, we need to talk. I don't know if I can do this anymore."
"04","13","22","JIMMY","Do what?"
"04","13","22","KIRSTEN","Us. I need to end this."
"04","13","22","JIMMY","What are you talking about? We have a plan. Go to college. Come back here, pick up where we left off."
"04","13","22","KIRSTEN","Jimmy, on paper, all of that makes sense. But in my heart it just doesn't feel right."
"04","13","22","JIMMY","I don't understand."
"04","13","22","KIRSTEN","You don't just wake up one morning and decide to change your entire life."
"04","13","22","JIMMY","Whatever it is, we'll figure it out together."
"04","13","22","KIRSTEN","It's already been figured out. I know what I want to do."
"04","13","22","JIMMY","Kirsten, what's going on?"
"04","13","22","KIRSTEN","I got into Berkeley."
"04","13","22","JIMMY","And you're going?"
"04","13","23","SUMMER","Don't you see we are supposed to control our own destiny? Mm-hmm. Or else what's the point of life if it's just something that happens to you?"
"04","13","23","SUMMER","George."
"04","13","23","SUMMER","George?"
"04","13","23","SUMMER","Oh... GEORGE."
"04","13","24","KAITLIN","It doesn't matter who it is. All that you need to know is that the game has changed. If you want to marry my mom, you're going to have to step your game up."
"04","13","24","GORDON","Well, old Bullit knows how to romance a lady. I've been married five times. Check this out. Emerald earrings for your mom, matches her eyes."
"04","13","24","KAITLIN","Just toss these, all right? I want something better. I want out-of-the-box thinking."
"04","13","24","GORDON","Hot air balloon ride. Hot air balloon. A blimp? Oh, heck, squirt, all I care about is that your mom is happy and if I'm not the man for that..."
"04","13","24","KAITLIN","No, Bullit, buck up. You want to marry my mom, right?"
"04","13","24","GORDON","Of course."
"04","13","24","KAITLIN","And you want to be my stepdad."
"04","13","24","GORDON","And play ping-pong with you till I'm old and gray. Hell, yeah. Let's go."
"04","13","24","KAITLIN","Then we need to make a plan. I want nothing less than the most spectacular Valentine's date ever. Is one of those planes yours?"
"04","13","24","GORDON","Two of 'em."
"04","13","25","TAYLOR","Okay, they're gonna play the money card,</i> but we can play the emotion card."
"04","13","25","FRANK","Am I right, Ryan?"
"04","13","25","RYAN","Yeah, you're right."
"04","13","25","TAYLOR","Okay, Frank, tell me what it is that you love about Julie."
"04","13","25","FRANK","Well, uh... She's, uh..."
"04","13","25","TAYLOR","I forgot what we're dealing with here. Atwoods on Valentine's Day."
"04","13","25","RYAN","I told you."
"04","13","25","FRANK","Look, I really appreciate this, but you guys don't have to do this for me. It's not your job."
"04","13","25","RYAN","We want to."
"04","13","25","TAYLOR","Mm, text from Kaitlin. ""Y'all are going down. Team Bullit."" Frank, if we're going to win, you need to give me something here."
"04","13","25","FRANK","Okay, Julie's amazing. All right? She's... she's pretty. She totally gets me?"
"04","13","25","TAYLOR","Come on. Dig deeper here! Look inside. What is it that connects you to her?"
"04","13","25","FRANK","We're just... from the same world."
"04","13","26","SANDY","You barely touched your chicken."
"04","13","26","KIRSTEN","I guess I wasn't in the mood for it."
"04","13","26","SANDY","Well, you're feeling nauseous and tired. So I can't expect you to be dancing on the tables. If something else is bothering you, tell me."
"04","13","26","KIRSTEN","I hate keeping secrets from you."
"04","13","26","SANDY","I didn't know you were."
"04","13","26","KIRSTEN","There's one thing. Something that I, I never told you"
"04","13","26","SANDY","Is this about Jimmy Cooper?"
"04","13","26","KIRSTEN","Can we get the check and talk about this at home?"
"04","13","27","JULIE","Thank you."
"04","13","27","KAITLIN","Mom, hold up. There's been a change in schedule."
"04","13","27","JULIE","Kaitlin, what's up?"
"04","13","27","KAITLIN","We have way cooler plans. And your ride should be here any second."
"04","13","27","KAITLIN","Nothing, I'm just getting in the spirit of things. Last-minute ambush. Should have seen this coming. How'd you find us?"
"04","13","27","RYAN","Taylor activated the GPS on your phone. Can I talk to you?"
"04","13","27","KAITLIN","Damn GPS. I should have thought of that."
"04","13","27","JULIE","What are you guys, the KGB? What's going on?"
"04","13","27","RYAN","I'll explain."
"04","13","27","KAITLIN","Mom, whatever he says, do not listen to him."
"04","13","27","RYAN","Look, I know you have plans tonight, but I was hoping you'd cancel them."
"04","13","27","JULIE","Oh, you found out about my case of the Franks."
"04","13","27","RYAN","He's waiting for you. He knows it's a long shot, but I said I'd try to get you to meet him. I'll drive if you want."
"04","13","27","KAITLIN","Mom, come on, your ride's here."
"04","13","27","JULIE","Tell your dad that in another life I'd be there. I'm sorry."
"04","13","27","KAITLIN","Mm, told you, Atwood. My team always wins."
"04","13","27","RYAN","I guess so.Wait. What?"
"04","13","27","KAITLIN","What the hell?"
"04","13","28","JULIE","Driver, could you turn the AC on, please?"
"04","13","28","TAYLOR","Yeah, sure, Ms. Cooper."
"04","13","29","KAITLIN","I cannot believe this."
"04","13","29","RYAN","Yeah, that's war, bitch."
"04","13","29","KAITLIN","God, Ryan, how could you be so mean? I'm only 15."
"04","13","29","RYAN","Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I don't know what I was thinking."
"04","13","29","KAITLIN","Me, either. You're going down."
"04","13","29","RYAN","Kaitlin..."
"04","13","29","KAITLIN","I'm following your decoy limo."
"04","13","29","RYAN","Then I'll follow you!"
"04","13","30","JULIE","Did Bullit buy me a hot dog stand? Uh, driver, I don't think this is right."
"04","13","30","TAYLOR","You're here."
"04","13","30","JULIE","Taylor? I don't know what to say. What is all this?"
"04","13","30","TAYLOR","Go, say it, like we practiced. Go."
"04","13","30","FRANK","Okay. Uh, this is sort of a testament to where we came from. But I really want tonight to be about where we could go. It's just a promise ring. I know it's not fancy. I wish I could offer you more, but this is all I have. And that is that I love you, the real you."
"04","13","30","JULIE","Frank, I..."
"04","13","30","KAITLIN","Mom, the Bullit's waiting."
"04","13","30","JULIE","Frank, I'm sorry. I have one daughter left and she loves Bullit, even if I don't. I'm sorry, Frank."
"04","13","31","KIRSTEN","And then after we had Seth and we were trying for a second and nothing was happening, I thought it was some kind of karmic payback."
"04","13","31","SANDY","Well, now you know it doesn't work like that. Why didn't you ever say anything?"
"04","13","31","KIRSTEN","Part of it was timing. It had only been a month. But then the best thing in the world happened to me."
"04","13","32","SANDY","Mondale and Ferraro. Mondale and Ferraro, path to equality."
"04","13","32","KIRSTEN","No, thanks."
"04","13","32","SANDY","What are you, a Republican? Oh, I'm sorry, did you catch it from your parents? I hear it's hereditary."
"04","13","32","KIRSTEN","I guess I did."
"04","13","32","SANDY","Well, if you don't want a pamphlet, here, have a pin, on me."
"04","13","32","KIRSTEN","I might wear it, but only because it's stylish."
"04","13","32","SANDY","You know, if you're not a pamphlet reader, I could take you to coffee...tell you all about why Mondale and Ferraro are gonna lose."
"04","13","32","KIRSTEN","If you're so sure they're gonna lose, why bother?"
"04","13","32","SANDY","I don't know, it feels right. So... coffee?"
"04","13","33","KIRSTEN","I guess I had fate on my mind</i> when I got you this gift."
"04","13","33","SANDY","Where on Earth did you find this?"
"04","13","33","KIRSTEN","I turned the house upside down."
"04","13","33","SANDY","If it hadn't been for Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro, there never would have been a Seth Cohen."
"04","13","33","KIRSTEN","There wouldn't be a Ryan."
"04","13","33","SANDY","And whoever this is going to be... All because of that one day. My lucky day."
"04","13","33","KIRSTEN","My lucky day."
"04","13","34","SETH","Okay, I admit it-- I put way too much stock into that poem."
"04","13","34","SUMMER","I'm not the girl that you thought I was."
"04","13","34","SETH","You're not.You, Summer, are better. See, back then you were just this fantasy. You were this little girl, who, when I would see, you would either ignore me, or make an obscene gesture and keep on walking."
"04","13","34","SUMMER","Yeah, I kind of remember that, sorry."
"04","13","34","SETH","But now look at you. You fight for sea otters. You've befriended Taylor Townsend. You're an incredible mom to that bunny."
"04","13","34","SUMMER","I guess I have changed."
"04","13","34","SETH","You've evolved. And over the last 950 days we've been dating... and, yes, I've counted and yes, I counted the Zach era, because, really, who were we kidding? I've watched you grow into this incredible woman. And that is who I love."
"04","13","34","SUMMER","Thanks, Cohen."
"04","13","34","SETH","What's wrong?"
"04","13","34","SUMMER","I met GEORGE."
"04","13","34","SETH","I'll kill him."
"04","13","34","SUMMER","This guy came by from GEORGE to recruit me. He heard about my work with the sea otters and invited me to travel across the country and talk to college kids about voting next November."
"04","13","34","SETH","What about Brown?"
"04","13","34","SUMMER","I'd have to defer a year, live on a bus."
"04","13","34","SETH","Sounds like a great gig."
"04","13","34","SUMMER","I don't know that we could see each other."
"04","13","34","SETH","So you have to choose between me and GEORGE."
"04","13","34","SUMMER","That's the thing I don't know that I have to. I do believe that you are my destiny, I do, Seth. But I just don't know that you're my only destiny. Here. Happy Valentine's Day. I picked couples through time."
"04","13","34","SETH","Oh, and where are we?"
"04","13","34","SUMMER","I was hoping that someday we could go in the middle."
"04","13","35","KAITLIN","So can I tell you what Bullit's surprise is? I can't hold it any longer."
"04","13","35","JULIE","Sure."
"04","13","35","KAITLIN","His plane is sitting on the tarmac gassed up and ready to take you anywhere in the world. Mom, you're going to be spendingValentine's Day anywhere in the world that you want to go. I mean, that's pretty amazing."
"04","13","35","JULIE","Yeah. Yeah, it really is."
"04","13","35","KAITLIN","No. Mom..."
"04","13","36","GORDON","Squirt, where the heck's your mom?"
"04","13","36","KAITLIN","I know I asked you to be my stepdad. Do you mind being my friend instead?"
"04","13","36","GORDON","So Julie's had enough of the old Bullit, eh?"
"04","13","36","KAITLIN","We can still play ping-pong together."
"04","13","36","GORDON","Come on. You know, I let you win."
"04","13","36","KAITLIN","No, you don't."
"04","13","36","GORDON","Yes, I do."
"04","13","36","KAITLIN","In your dreams."
"04","13","36","GORDON","You ever see that movie Casablanca?"
"04","13","36","KAITLIN","No."
"04","13","37","RYAN","Come on, luck be a lady, luck be a lady. Oh! I can't believe this, I didn't win."
"04","13","37","FRANK","Shocking."
"04","13","37","TAYLOR","Well, if it's any consolation, though, this soft serv is outstanding. Would anyone like seconds?"
"04","13","37","RYAN","Yeah, I would."
"04","13","37","FRANK","Yeah, me, too. Thank you."
"04","13","37","RYAN","Sorry things didn't work out with you and Julie."
"04","13","37","FRANK","Hey... I'm sitting here sharing ice cream with my kid. It's been a long time since I've done that. Tell me that's her."
"04","13","37","RYAN","That's her."
"04","13","37","FRANK","I'm suddenly nervous."
"04","13","37","RYAN","You're going to be great."
"04","13","37","JULIE","I'm having the strangest craving for a corn dog."
"04","13","37","FRANK","There may be one left. Seat?"
"04","13","37","TAYLOR","How about that? Fourth quarter, Team Frank comes through in the clutch."
"04","13","37","RYAN","Oh, yeah."
"04","13","37","TAYLOR","True love on Valentine's Day. What more could you ask for?"
"04","13","37","RYAN","Yeah... Hey, uh, so, you know, we reserved the limo for another two hours. What do you say we drive down the beach?"
"04","13","37","TAYLOR","Uh, that sounds suspiciously like a Valentine's Day date to me. I don't know, that might make us break up."
"04","13","37","RYAN","What if I said... I had newfound faith?"
"04","13","37","TAYLOR","I would say I agree."
"04","13","37","RYAN","I have newfound faith."
"04","13","37","TAYLOR","I agree. Okay. Onward, Jeeves. Yes, yes, yes, to the beach."
"04","14","0","SUMMER","I'm not buying you lingerie for your birthday. That's just weird."
"04","14","0","TAYLOR","Okay, that's fine. I told you, you don't have to buy me anything. You and Ryan are throwing me a birthday party and that's enough."
"04","14","0","SUMMER","Look, I know you've never had a birthday party before, let alone been to one, but usually people get presents for their birthday, so will you please tell me what you want?"
"04","14","0","TAYLOR","Okay, honestly, I want Ryan to ask me to go to Berkeley with him next year."
"04","14","0","SUMMER","Okay, I was thinking more along the lines of a cute top."
"04","14","0","TAYLOR","I know, I know, it's just, I'm a planner, and I've already seeing that day six months in the future when we all go our separate ways. And I just know that if Ryan goes to Berkeley and I go to... Harvard or Princeton or Oxford, then it's over."
"04","14","0","SUMMER","Don't you have to apply to Berkeley first in order to... You already applied to Berkeley? Does Ryan know this?"
"04","14","0","TAYLOR","No.I applied before we even started dating. I just got back from France and I figured, well, I had to go somewhere, so I reapplied to Princeton, Oxford,Yale, Harvard and the Sorbonne, and I figured why not throw Berkeley in?"
"04","14","0","SUMMER","Um, hi. Can we get two coffees, please?"
"04","14","0","SUMMER","Okay. So you want to get Ryan to tell you that he wants you to go to Berkeley, without knowing that you already got in to Berkeley?"
"04","14","0","TAYLOR","Exactly."
"04","14","0","SUMMER","And how're you going to do that?"
"04","14","0","TAYLOR","Easy.I just need to get him to tell me that he loves me."
"04","14","0","SUMMER","Mm-hmm, Ryan talking about his feelings. Now that would be an earth-shattering event."
"04","14","0","SUMMER","Thank you."
"04","14","0","TAYLOR","Thanks."
"04","14","0","SUMMER","Did you see this about earthquake weather? You know, it's exactly this kind of voodoo science that lets politicians deny global warming."
"04","14","0","TAYLOR","Oh, my God, I know. And how many times have they predicted the big one, and it never happens. It almost makes you wish that it would."
"04","14","1","RYAN","Good morning. What's the occasion?"
"04","14","1","TAYLOR","Just you're being so sweet throwing me a birthday party, and I wanted to thank you, so... Oh, my gosh, did I ever tell you about..."
"04","14","1","RYAN","How you've never had a birthday party and you've always spent every birthday alone in your room watching Sixteen Candles and talking to a gypsy on the psychic hot line?"
"04","14","1","TAYLOR","Yeah, I know, I'm a broken record. Just, you know, it really means a lot to me that you're doing this for me."
"04","14","1","RYAN","Well, Taylor, I'll tell you, planning your birthday party is not easy. I expect something in return."
"04","14","1","TAYLOR","Oh."
"04","14","1","RYAN","I expect to have my way with you."
"04","14","1","TAYLOR","Ryan!"
"04","14","1","RYAN","Well, all that time and energy. Clowns, balloons, a magician..."
"04","14","1","TAYLOR","Oh, oh, well, if there's a magician. It's kind of strange to think about all of this ending isn't it?"
"04","14","1","RYAN","Hmm?"
"04","14","1","TAYLOR","You, going off to Berkeley, me, whichever way the wind blows."
"04","14","1","RYAN","Well, it's still six months away."
"04","14","1","TAYLOR","Right, yeah. If only I had a crystal ball, huh? Maybe I should call Esmerelda from the psychic hot line."
"04","14","1","RYAN","This a really good croissant."
"04","14","1","TAYLOR","Don't you have the feeling that we're on the cusp of something and we just need to leap into the void?"
"04","14","1","RYAN","Did you get these at Joe's?"
"04","14","1","TAYLOR","Ryan, don't you have that feeling?"
"04","14","1","RYAN","What?"
"04","14","1","TAYLOR","That life is telling us to take a wild, impulsive jump into the unknown?"
"04","14","1","RYAN","Not really."
"04","14","1","TAYLOR","So, you're good? You don't have a need to just let something explode out of you, consequences be damned?"
"04","14","1","RYAN","What are we talking about?"
"04","14","1","TAYLOR","Well, I was... I guess it's just my birthday and I'm getting sentimental."
"04","14","1","RYAN","All right, well, don't worry. It's going to be great. Okay? All right, I've got to go. Thanks for this. Hey, tonight, you want to do something? See a movie?"
"04","14","1","TAYLOR","Yeah, sure, okay."
"04","14","1","RYAN","All right, great."
"04","14","2","KAITLIN","Oh, my God."
"04","14","2","JULIE","Oh, hi, honey. Sorry, I didn't hear you coming down."
"04","14","2","KAITLIN","Mom, do you mind? Because I still have to eat in here."
"04","14","2","JULIE","What can I get you?"
"04","14","2","KAITLIN","You want some scrambled eggs or I could whip up some pancakes."
"04","14","2","FRANK","You cook, too? That's amazing."
"04","14","2","JULIE","It's just a talent I have."
"04","14","2","FRANK","Yeah, one of many."
"04","14","2","KAITLIN","I'm seriously never going to stop barfing."
"04","14","2","JULIE","Kaitlin, don't be gross."
"04","14","2","KAITLIN","Me? Gross? What's gross is Frank's dirty... germy convict bag is sitting on the counter. I mean, what, did the warden give that to you as a going-away present?"
"04","14","2","JULIE","Kaitlin..."
"04","14","2","FRANK","It's okay. It's okay. It shouldn't be on the counter. Though I actually got it at REI."
"04","14","2","KAITLIN","Well, why bother with a bag? You can just move in. You spend enough time here anyway."
"04","14","2","JULIE","Young lady, apologize."
"04","14","2","KAITLIN","I'm sorry, Frank. Feel free to have as many conjugal visits as you'd like."
"04","14","2","FRANK","You know, I... I should get going. I've got a job interview."
"04","14","2","JULIE","I'll walk you out."
"04","14","2","FRANK","Okay."
"04","14","2","JULIE","And we'll talk later."
"04","14","3","KIRSTEN","Oh, hi."
"04","14","3","KIRSTEN","Oh, yes, I am. And you?"
"04","14","3","KIRSTEN","Oh, not-not very. I just found out, too."
"04","14","3","KIRSTEN","I should probably stretch before class."
"04","14","3","KIRSTEN","All the time."
"04","14","4","RYAN","Summer, what's up?"
"04","14","4","SUMMER","Hey. I am just picking up Seth. Taking him to an art exhibition, sponsored by GEORGE, the Global Environmental Organization regarding Greenhouse Emissions."
"04","14","4","RYAN","Seth's going to an art show."
"04","14","4","SUMMER","Well, yeah, I mean, he's going to art school, and I like the environment,so I thought it was the perfect date."
"04","14","4","RYAN","Sure."
"04","14","4","SUMMER","So are you ready for Taylor's party?"
"04","14","4","RYAN","Oh, yeah, party's all set. Even got her a present."
"04","14","4","SUMMER","Really. Mind telling me what it is?"
"04","14","4","RYAN","Well, you know, she likes translating those French love poems? I collected a few. Had them bound for her."
"04","14","4","SUMMER","Atwood, that is so romantic. You know, nothing is as romantic as the first time you tell someone you love them,though, huh?"
"04","14","4","RYAN","I, uh... haven't told Taylor I love her."
"04","14","4","SUMMER","You haven't?"
"04","14","4","RYAN","Has she said something?"
"04","14","4","SUMMER","No. No, I-I just assumed. You guys have been together for a while and you seem pretty happy. I thought,""Why wouldn't you have said I love you?"" I have an idea. Why don't you?"
"04","14","4","RYAN","What?"
"04","14","4","SUMMER","For her birthday. You should, because... the book of poems is awesome, but add that special little ""I love you. As as girl,I don't know, me personally, I got chills."
"04","14","4","RYAN","Does Taylor expect me to tell her that I love her on her birthday?"
"04","14","4","SUMMER","What? No. I don't know. I've got to go."
"04","14","5","KAITLIN","I can't stay, okay?"
"04","14","5","FRANK","Well, thanks for meeting me."
"04","14","5","KAITLIN","I wanted to talk to you alone. You're not going to do anything pervy are you?"
"04","14","5","FRANK","Kaitlin... I care about your mom. And considering my past, I understand why you're suspicious."
"04","14","5","KAITLIN","Look, I really don't care that you went to prison, all right? I mean, the Bullet went to prison and he was awesome. You're just boring."
"04","14","5","FRANK","I'm sorry, but it's just the way it is. Well, I have to say I don't think that's fair. You hardly know me."
"04","14","5","KAITLIN","Then say something funny."
"04","14","5","FRANK","What?"
"04","14","5","KAITLIN","Make me laugh."
"04","14","5","FRANK","Fine. I don't know what interests a 15-year-old girl, but your mother doesn't think I'm boring."
"04","14","5","KAITLIN","Well, that's because you're sleeping with her."
"04","14","5","FRANK","Can you not say that kind of thing?"
"04","14","5","KAITLIN","Well, what do you want me to say? I mean, is it true in prison on your first day, you got to make someone your bitch? Or what about the whole dropping the soap thing? I mean, really,why don't you guys just install soap dispensers?"
"04","14","5","FRANK","Hey, I make your mom happy. I'm just asking for a chance here, Kaitlin."
"04","14","5","KAITLIN","Of course. If it makes my mom happy."
"04","14","6","JULIE","Oh, my God. Oh... my God."
"04","14","7","SUMMER","It's so beautiful. Just forget how the ocean ties us all together. You know, he's so right. If we aren't good custodians for our planet, what right do we have to be here? Don't you think that was amazing?"
"04","14","7","SETH","Mm-hmm. I give it a three."
"04","14","7","SUMMER","A three? He put a radio transmitter in a piece of trash, threw it into the ocean, followed it around for six years just to show how pollution travels. And you're giving it a three?"
"04","14","7","SETH","I'm gonna give it a three-and-a-half, then."
"04","14","7","SUMMER","What about the part where he followed it through the oil fires in the Persian Gulf, and he got third-degree burns on his arms?"
"04","14","7","SETH","I know, but the camera work was terrible, and what kind of film stock was he using? The oranges and reds totally bled together."
"04","14","7","SUMMER","He was just making a point to show the health of our planet."
"04","14","7","SETH","Yeah, but he's also making a movie,and as a movie, it sucks."
"04","14","7","SUMMER","Well, what about that one? Where the turtle adopted the hippo who was lost in the tsunami?"
"04","14","7","SETH","Mm-hmm. That's pretty much the nature film equivalent of a chick flick."
"04","14","7","SUMMER","Okay. What about that? Where the family giraffes habitat was destroyed."
"04","14","7","SETH","Yeah, shot like a perfume ad."
"04","14","7","SUMMER","God, what is your problem,Seth? I just want you to get excited about something."
"04","14","7","SETH","I am, about things that are good. But I could do one of these doughnuts with both hands tied behind my back."
"04","14","7","SUMMER","Really?Prove it."
"04","14","7","SETH","What?"
"04","14","7","SUMMER","Make a movie."
"04","14","7","SETH","Are you serious?"
"04","14","7","SUMMER","Yeah. I want see you do it better. I want to go watch the penguins again, and don't you dare say anything."
"04","14","8","SANDY","Hey, I didn't know you were coming by. I was just at Spitzy's office. You should have called. Is everything all right?"
"04","14","8","KIRSTEN","The people in Newport are awful."
"04","14","8","SANDY","Honey, you're a little late to the party. I've been saying that for 20 years."
"04","14","8","KIRSTEN","Has it gotten worse? I mean, I know Julie and some of the othersare bad, but..."
"04","14","8","SANDY","What happened?"
"04","14","8","KIRSTEN","I was at this prenatal yoga class and these young women they're monsters. They wanted me to join the six-pack pack."
"04","14","8","SANDY","The what?"
"04","14","8","KIRSTEN","And then they talk about inducing labor at eight months so that they don't have to gain weight. Can we raise another child around this?"
"04","14","8","SANDY","Oh, honey, Newport's always had that element, and still we managed to have life. And not everybody's like that. You know what? Spitz has been wanting us to meet his wife. How about we do dinner tomorrow? Restore your faith in humanity."
"04","14","8","KIRSTEN","All right."
"04","14","8","SANDY","But more importantly, do you think they'll let me join the six-pack pack? I've been doing my sit-ups. Come on, hit me with your best shot. Go ahead, come on, wind up. I'm not a beast!"
"04","14","9","TAYLOR","Oh, God, he really loves her. And she is never going to know how he feels, because he can't tell her. Isn't that tragic?"
"04","14","9","RYAN","Yep."
"04","14","9","TAYLOR","I mean, how could you do that? How could you just let the love of your life slip away because you were too afraid to tell them how you really felt?"
"04","14","9","RYAN","Well, maybe she's better off."
"04","14","9","TAYLOR","Uh-huh. Did you get that from the scene where she was about to be burned at the stake?"
"04","14","9","RYAN","No, she's a beautiful woman, he's a hunchback who lives in a bell tower. The chances of it working out..."
"04","14","9","TAYLOR","Yeah, but he doesn't know that. If he at least told her how he felt, then maybe there would be a way to work things out. You know, they could have a life together. Or you know, at least four more years. Why did you save me?"
"04","14","9","RYAN","But the archbishop..."
"04","14","9","TAYLOR","Ryan, I'm not talking about the movie. It's... There's just moments in everyone's life, and if you just let them slip away, then... then they're gone forever. And that's the tragic thing about life. Don't you feel that way?"
"04","14","9","RYAN","Taylor.I...missed the last part of the movie Would you mind rewinding it a little?"
"04","14","9","TAYLOR","Sure."
"04","14","9","RYAN","Thanks."
"04","14","9","TAYLOR","Lonely, huh? Better get used to it, buddy."
"04","14","10","SUMMER","Good morning."
"04","14","10","TAYLOR","If you say so."
"04","14","10","SUMMER","What's that?"
"04","14","10","TAYLOR","This is the obituary for mine and Ryan's relationship. A rose, plucked before its time."
"04","14","10","SUMMER","Uh-huh, English?"
"04","14","10","TAYLOR","I wrote a letter to the Dean of Berkeley, telling him that I must respectfully decline the scholarship, and he should offer it to the next candidate."
"04","14","10","SUMMER","So you're saying no? What happened with Ryan?"
"04","14","10","TAYLOR","I tried, Summer, I really did. The moment was upon us. We were staring into each other's eyes,and... And he just didn't say it. You know, sometimes I just want to grab him and tie him to a chair and shoot him full of sodium pentathol and see what spills out."
"04","14","10","SUMMER","Why don't you?"
"04","14","10","TAYLOR","You don't think it's too crazy? Because I was thinking if the two of us just tackled him and then we could tie him down..."
"04","14","10","SUMMER","I wasn't talking literally."
"04","14","10","TAYLOR","Oh."
"04","14","10","SUMMER","Do you love him?"
"04","14","10","TAYLOR","Yeah, I really do."
"04","14","10","SUMMER","Do you think he loves you?"
"04","14","10","TAYLOR","Well, sometimes he grabs my handand he squeezes it for no reason. I mean, what else could that mean?"
"04","14","10","SUMMER","Okay. So we just need to loosen his tongue a little."
"04","14","10","TAYLOR","But how are we going to... Summer Roberts, you bad thing."
"04","14","10","SUMMER","Okay, you know what, a trip to the Robert's wine cellar is in order."
"04","14","11","SANDY","What the hell is he doing?"
"04","14","11","RYAN","Morning."
"04","14","11","SANDY","Morning. Hey, are y all right?"
"04","14","11","RYAN","Yeah, it's just a cramp."
"04","14","11","SANDY","How far did you go?"
"04","14","11","RYAN","Mm, nine, ten miles."
"04","14","11","SANDY","Oh. Wouldn't it be easier if you just said,""Sandy, there's something bothering me. Can you give me some advice?"""
"04","14","11","RYAN","Yes, it would,but where's the fun in that?"
"04","14","11","SANDY","Let me guess. You're trying to decide if you love Taylor so you can tell her on her birthday."
"04","14","11","RYAN","Huh?"
"04","14","11","SANDY","You've been dating for a while, things are good, birthday's tomorrow. Bingo."
"04","14","11","RYAN","Yeah. You're good."
"04","14","11","SANDY","So? Do you love her?"
"04","14","11","RYAN","Uh, honestly I'm scared."
"04","14","11","SANDY","Good, you should be."
"04","14","11","RYAN","That's reassuring."
"04","14","11","SANDY","Well, it might be the most powerful thing you can say to another person. It changes everything. Now for heaven's sake, if you don't feel it,don't say it."
"04","14","11","RYAN","Yeah, it's just I think she's expecting it."
"04","14","11","SANDY","And to not say it... It's like saying you don't love her."
"04","14","11","RYAN","Exactly."
"04","14","11","SANDY","Well, do you care about her?"
"04","14","11","RYAN","Of course."
"04","14","11","SANDY","Do you enjoy being with her?"
"04","14","11","RYAN","More than with anyone."
"04","14","11","SANDY","Tell her that. It won't be exactly what she wants to hear,but it'll be honest."
"04","14","11","RYAN","All right."
"04","14","11","SANDY","Can you tell me something?"
"04","14","11","RYAN","Sure."
"04","14","11","SANDY","Do you have any idea why Seth is filming the pool?"
"04","14","12","RYAN","Sounds great."
"04","14","12","SETH","Yeah, I'll tell you about it later. Uh, Taylor called. She wants you to go over there for dinner."
"04","14","12","RYAN","Oh, okay."
"04","14","12","SETH","Yeah. Okay. Ah, it's perfect."
"04","14","13","JULIE","Look, Frank, I get that men have urges, and I imagine prison is one of those places where those urges get twisted, but..."
"04","14","13","FRANK","Julie..."
"04","14","13","JULIE","I've never even heard of clown p0rn. I mean that photo where they're all stuffed into the little car..."
"04","14","13","FRANK","It's not mine."
"04","14","13","JULIE","Oh, really? It was just in your bag, along with... this? I mean, which one of us is supposed to wear this?"
"04","14","13","FRANK","Julie, none of this is mine."
"04","14","13","JULIE","So someone just went into your bag, planted a wig and some really bad clown p0rn. Who would...? Oh... Kaitlin."
"04","14","13","FRANK","Julie, it's all right."
"04","14","13","JULIE","No, Frank, it's not. My daughter is trying to sabotage this relationship. And where would she get her hands on clown p0rn?"
"04","14","13","FRANK","She's just hazing me, you know? It'll be good for me to show her that I can take it. It'll blow over. It's not serious."
"04","14","13","JULIE","Did you see p.50?"
"04","14","14","SUMMER","How much more of this is there?"
"04","14","14","SETH","Five hours and 58 minutes. What are you doing?"
"04","14","14","SUMMER","I'm not going to sit here and watch six hours of the pool. I told you to become engaged in something. Instead, you just set up a tripod."
"04","14","14","SETH","It's a satire. It's a comment on the lack of artistic rigor..."
"04","14","14","SUMMER","No, it's you being lazy. How many naps did you take while you made this?"
"04","14","14","SETH","I took two to res... Do you feel like you're overreacting a little bit? I mean, what does it really matter?"
"04","14","14","SUMMER","That's the problem, Seth. You did this because you chose the path of least resistance. You know, you could have made a movie about anything in your life, and instead you chose this."
"04","14","14","SETH","So what am I supposed to do? Follow Ryan around with a camera until he punches someone?"
"04","14","14","SUMMER","Yes, anything that engages you in the world."
"04","14","14","SETH","What is the point?"
"04","14","14","SUMMER","Well, if nothing else,it's important to me."
"04","14","15","SANDY","Thanks. Mr. Spitz."
"04","14","15","KIRSTEN","Hello, Jason."
"04","14","15","SANDY","You, too."
"04","14","15","SANDY","Wow, I imagine that could be a little hard to handle."
"04","14","15","KIRSTEN","So, Carrie, you're from Newport?"
"04","14","15","KIRSTEN","Really. Interesting."
"04","14","16","RYAN","Oh, thanks, that's good."
"04","14","16","TAYLOR","For luck."
"04","14","16","RYAN","Uh, actually, I'm not that big a wine drinker."
"04","14","16","TAYLOR","I know, you can't have coq au vin without the vin."
"04","14","16","RYAN","Well, that's true."
"04","14","16","TAYLOR","Okay."
"04","14","16","RYAN","You know, I feel kind of bad, you making dinner the day before your birthday."
"04","14","16","TAYLOR","No, it's my pleasure. Absolutely. Oh, sorry."
"04","14","16","RYAN","It's okay."
"04","14","16","TAYLOR","I'm nervous 'cause I've never cooked for you before. Okay, cheers."
"04","14","16","RYAN","Oh, yeah."
"04","14","16","TAYLOR","Whoo, bottoms up. Mmm. Tasty."
"04","14","16","RYAN","So, uh...Oh, that's... So, Taylor, there's something I want to talk to you about."
"04","14","16","TAYLOR","No, let's save all the serious conversation for after dinner. We don't want it to get cold."
"04","14","16","RYAN","Okay."
"04","14","16","TAYLOR","Hmm, I think I need another sip. Wow, do you detect a hint of blackberries?"
"04","14","16","RYAN","Mm, no, I don't."
"04","14","16","TAYLOR","Try it. It's fun, come on."
"04","14","16","RYAN","Uh... Okay. Mm. Nope, no blackberries."
"04","14","16","TAYLOR","I think you need to take a bigger sip."
"04","14","17","SANDY","You still go to your sorority rush?"
"04","14","17","KIRSTEN","I can only imagine."
"04","14","17","SANDY","You know, I'm afraid it's getting a little late for us."
"04","14","17","SANDY","Maybe another time."
"04","14","17","KIRSTEN","Actually, I'm an alcoholic."
"04","14","17","KIRSTEN","Oh, you know,Sandy, I'm-I'm, uh, suddenly... I'm, I'm not feeling well."
"04","14","17","SANDY","I'd better get you home. Thank you both for an unforgettable evening. Jason, I'll talk to you Monday."
"04","14","17","KIRSTEN","Sure."
"04","14","18","TAYLOR","I don't understand how you're not drunk."
"04","14","18","RYAN","Oh, it's the Atwood genes. We're built to withstand massive quantities of alcohol."
"04","14","18","TAYLOR","Ooh."
"04","14","19","TAYLOR","But if I can't get you drunk, you'll never tell me you love me."
"04","14","19","RYAN","Oh, Taylor."
"04","14","19","TAYLOR","I know, I know. Bad Taylor. I shouldn't have tried to get you drunk. Just like I shouldn't have pretended to be your sleep therapist, or rented Roger the homosexual, or stalked you wearing a Groundhog costume, or... What else did I do?"
"04","14","19","RYAN","I-I think that's it."
"04","14","19","TAYLOR","I'm going to go to sleep now. Oh. Good-bye, Ryan. It was nice."
"04","14","19","RYAN","Taylor. Taylor? Are you pretending to go to sleep, thinking I'll tell you I love you while you're unconscious?"
"04","14","19","TAYLOR","Maybe. Don't laugh at me."
"04","14","19","RYAN","I'm not."
"04","14","19","TAYLOR","It's hard dating someone who doesn't tell you how they feel and always having to interpret hand squeezes and..."
"04","14","19","RYAN","I love you."
"04","14","19","TAYLOR","What?"
"04","14","19","RYAN","I love you."
"04","14","19","TAYLOR","You do?"
"04","14","19","RYAN","Uh, yeah."
"04","14","19","TAYLOR","I can't believe you just said it."
"04","14","19","RYAN","Neither can I."
"04","14","19","TAYLOR","Oh, I love you, too."
"04","14","19","RYAN","Oh, good."
"04","14","19","TAYLOR","Yay!Yay! Now we can go to Berkeley together."
"04","14","19","RYAN","What?"
"04","14","19","TAYLOR","Yeah.Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got into Berkeley. I applied, and I got this letter, and put it on my desk and..."
"04","14","20","SETH","Ryan Atwood. His face betrays no emotion, but what passions lurk behind those eyes? Answering that is the purpose of this film. Come with me, my friends."
"04","14","20","RYAN","I thought the movie was about the pool."
"04","14","20","SETH","Summer didn't really take to six hours of the pool. She wanted me to make a movie in which I engage with people. What is Ryan Atwood wrapping so intently? Taylor's birthday present. Ah, Taylor Townsend, the fast-talking Eve Harrington who melted Ryan Atwood's heart. Tell us, Ryan,how does it feel to have Dean Hess's sloppy seconds? Or what did you get her? Either one."
"04","14","20","RYAN","Um... well, uh, one of her hobbies is translating French love poems, so I had them bound for her."
"04","14","20","SETH","Wow. That is really romantic."
"04","14","20","RYAN","Well, it's, it's not that romantic."
"04","14","20","SETH","Are you kidding? You may as well tell her you love her."
"04","14","20","RYAN","It's, uh, it's actually a little late for that."
"04","14","20","SETH","What?"
"04","14","20","RYAN","Yeah."
"04","14","21","SUMMER","And then what happened?"
"04","14","21","TAYLOR","Well, we finished dinner and he still wasn't drunk, so I suggested a drinking game. I called it ""Drink."" Whenever I said ""drink,"" we drank."
"04","14","21","SUMMER","Simple but effective."
"04","14","21","TAYLOR","Yeah, a little too effective. I ended up on the coffee table singing ""Part of Your World"" and telling him he was my Prince Eric."
"04","14","21","SUMMER","Uh, did he say it?"
"04","14","21","TAYLOR","Yes."
"04","14","21","SUMMER","He did?!"
"04","14","21","TAYLOR","Yeah!"
"04","14","21","SUMMER","Oh, my God, that's amazing. Ow. Ryan told you he loved you."
"04","14","21","TAYLOR","I know. I mean, I think he said it."
"04","14","22","RYAN","Yeah, this feeling just kind of came over me and... I couldn't stop myself."
"04","14","22","SETH","So why the long face? You regretting it?"
"04","14","22","RYAN","Well... it turns out she applied to Berkeley without telling me, and now..."
"04","14","22","SETH","Your spur-of-the-moment ""I love you"" issuddenly committing you to four more years. The plot thickens."
"04","14","22","RYAN","I'm not saying it'd be bad. It just seems like all of a sudden we're going mach five."
"04","14","22","SETH","You'd like to turn down the heat a little."
"04","14","23","TAYLOR","He definitely said it."
"04","14","23","SUMMER","Absolutely."
"04","14","23","TAYLOR","I think."
"04","14","23","SUMMER","Well, don't you think you'd remember?"
"04","14","23","TAYLOR","I don't know; it hurts. Summer, what am I going to do? I can't just ask him, by the way, did you tell me you loved me last night? Because I was too plastered to remember."
"04","14","23","SUMMER","Right. Okay. Today's your birthday right? And I happen to know that he got you a crazy, romantic present. So when you open it tonight, why don't you just be like ""Oh, my gosh, Ryan, I love you,"" and if he said it last night, he'll say it again."
"04","14","23","TAYLOR","You're a genius."
"04","14","23","SUMMER","Yes, I am; it's all up here. It's just there might be one other tiny little thing."
"04","14","24","SETH","I'm not saying take it back, but today's her birthday, right? So she's going to be interpreting every little thing. So maybe you send her a message. For instance, that sends the message ""You're the only girl in the world for me. Let's move to a co-op in Berkeley."" Is that what you want to say? We go off Ryan Atwood. What will he do? How will this situation resolve itself?"
"04","14","25","SUMMER","You said something about Berkeley?"
"04","14","25","TAYLOR","I'm not sure. Maybe I was just talking about him going to Berkeley. That would make sense, right?"
"04","14","25","JULIE","Morning, girls. Happy birthday, Taylor."
"04","14","25","TAYLOR","Thanks, Julie."
"04","14","25","JULIE","Oh, I gave the mailman that letter from the counter."
"04","14","25","TAYLOR","What letter? The letter to Berkeley?"
"04","14","25","JULIE","Yeah, I think so."
"04","14","25","TAYLOR","Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
"04","14","26","TAYLOR","Uh-uh! Mister! Mail carrier, sir. Excuse me, please. Um, could you wait? Hi. I'm sorry. Um, a woman in that house where I live just gave you a letter that she shouldn't have,and, uh, I kind of need it back."
"04","14","26","TAYLOR","Okay, and I totally understand that, but if you take that letter, I am going to lose my place at Berkeley and the chance to be with the man I love and who I think loves me, and, and 15 years from now, when he is trapped in a loveless marriage and I have become a cold, hard ice queen for whom love is no more than a distant memory, it will come down to the fact that on this morning, which coincidentally happens to be my birthday, you obeyed the letter of the law at the expense of simple, human charity."
"04","14","26","TAYLOR","Can I have my letter now?"
"04","14","27","FRANK","Hey."
"04","14","27","RYAN","I didn't know you were a runner."
"04","14","27","FRANK","Yeah,it helps me to work stuff out You should try it."
"04","14","27","RYAN","Maybe I will. Everything okay?"
"04","14","27","FRANK","Yeah. No, I was just,uh, nearby. I figured I'd stop in and say hello, ask your advice on winning over a 15-year-old Newport girl."
"04","14","27","RYAN","Kaitlin giving you trouble?"
"04","14","27","FRANK","Well, things with Julie are great, and I-I'm so grateful to you and Taylor,but Caitlin, she just... I don't know,she just seems to want to shut me out. And I know that you have some experience with the Cooper women, so..."
"04","14","27","RYAN","Well, a Porsche would probably do the trick."
"04","14","27","FRANK","Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's not really in my budget."
"04","14","27","RYAN","Well, Kaitlin's had a tough year. You know. Once she sees that her mom's happy, she'll come around. Just be patient."
"04","14","27","FRANK","Ah... suddenly a Porsche sounds like a bargain."
"04","14","27","RYAN","Right. Uh, look,I, I got to get going, help set up Taylor's party."
"04","14","27","FRANK","Oh, sure. Is that, is that her present?"
"04","14","27","RYAN","Oh, yeah, it's, uh... she translated these French love poems so I had them bound in leatherfor her."
"04","14","27","FRANK","Oh, my son the romantic."
"04","14","27","RYAN","Yeah."
"04","14","27","FRANK","So I'll, uh, see you tonight."
"04","14","27","RYAN","Yeah. It's not that romantic."
"04","14","28","SUMMER","Taylor, it's going to be fine. Ryan's going to give you a really romantic present, tell you he loves you, and you guys are going to wind up going to Berkeley together. Don't worry."
"04","14","28","TAYLOR","Okay, yeah, I know. Do you think I should act surprised when I go to the party?"
"04","14","28","SUMMER","But it's not a surprise party."
"04","14","28","TAYLOR","Well, I know, but it might make Ryan feel good."
"04","14","28","SUMMER","Okay, it's a great idea."
"04","14","28","TAYLOR","Ah!"
"04","14","29","TAYLOR","Oh, my God, what a surprise."
"04","14","29","SANDY","Oh, I didn't know it was a surprise party."
"04","14","29","SUMMER","Just go with it, okay? It's Taylor."
"04","14","29","RYAN","Happy birthday."
"04","14","29","TAYLOR","This is a-amazing."
"04","14","29","RYAN","Yeah, well, you deserve it. You got a lot of birthdays to catch up on."
"04","14","29","TAYLOR","Is everything okay?"
"04","14","29","RYAN","Yeah, absolutely. Let me get you a drink."
"04","14","29","TAYLOR","Okay."
"04","14","29","JULIE","Happy birthday."
"04","14","29","TAYLOR","Thank you."
"04","14","29","KAITLIN","Happy birthday."
"04","14","30","SANDY","We can move. I mean it. Ryan and Seth will be gone in six months. We could put the house on the market, throw a dart at the map. Maybe it's time."
"04","14","30","KIRSTEN","But this is our home."
"04","14","30","SANDY","So? We'll make some place new our home. You know? We'll still have our memories."
"04","14","30","KIRSTEN","But when Ryan and Seth come home for the holidays, I want them to come home to that house."
"04","14","30","SANDY","It was an idea."
"04","14","30","KIRSTEN","Well, thanks, Sandy. I just don't think I can."
"04","14","31","TAYLOR","Oh, my God. It's a replica of the green destiny sword from Crouching Tiger. Oh, my God, thank you so much Seth."
"04","14","31","SETH","Glad you like it."
"04","14","31","TAYLOR","It's so neat."
"04","14","31","SUMMER","Open Ryan's present."
"04","14","31","TAYLOR","Okay. Where is it?"
"04","14","31","RYAN","Oh, no, no, no. It's okay."
"04","14","31","KIRSTEN","Ryan's embarrassed."
"04","14","31","RYAN","No, it's just, it's um, personal."
"04","14","31","SANDY","Well, I hope so."
"04","14","31","TAYLOR","Oh, my God. It's a... It's a dictionary?"
"04","14","31","KIRSTEN","That is practical."
"04","14","31","RYAN","Yeah, the guy said that it, um, had more words than others."
"04","14","31","SANDY","Well, that's good, being as it is a dictionary."
"04","14","31","SETH","It's red-- that's a cool color."
"04","14","32","SUMMER","I still love him, you know? I'm sorry, I shouldn't be telling you this."
"04","14","32","KIRSTEN","No, I understand. I worry about him a lot."
"04","14","32","SUMMER","You know, I know making this movie just seems so stupid, but I just wanted him to get excited about something, you know? Anything."
"04","14","32","KIRSTEN","Just give him a chance. Seth will find his way."
"04","14","32","SUMMER","I hope so. He just seems a little lost."
"04","14","33","KAITLIN","Those are mine."
"04","14","33","JULIE","What do you think you're doing?"
"04","14","33","KAITLIN","What? The guy likes clown p0rn. I think everyone should know."
"04","14","33","JULIE","Do you have any idea how humiliated Frank would be if he saw, or if Ryan saw it? It's his father, Kaitlin."
"04","14","33","KAITLIN","Whatever."
"04","14","33","JULIE","Do not walk away from me. I've tried to be understanding. I'm sorry if Frank isn't as hilarious as Bullit was."
"04","14","33","KAITLIN","It's not even about that."
"04","14","33","JULIE","Then what is it? Is it the money?"
"04","14","33","KAITLIN","Mom, look at us. In the past year we've lost Dad, we've lost Marissa, we had Dr. Roberts and we lost him. And then we got the Bullit, lost him. What makes you think that this guy is going to stick around any longer?"
"04","14","33","JULIE","Kaitlin, am I crazy, or did you say that it was okay for me to date Frank?"
"04","14","33","KAITLIN","Yes, to date him. But it's been a week and he's practically living in our house. Like he's family. He is not family You and I are. I mean, why can't we just act like that for a little while?"
"04","14","33","FRANK","Hey. They're about to bring out the cake. Everything okay?"
"04","14","33","JULIE","Yes, everything's fine. Kaitlin, why don't you go back inside."
"04","14","34","RYAN","Taylor. Taylor, I'm sorry."
"04","14","34","TAYLOR","I'm not crazy, right? Last night, you did tell me you loved me."
"04","14","34","RYAN","Yeah, I did."
"04","14","34","TAYLOR","Okay, then what? Are you trying to send me a message? Do you wish you hadn't said it?"
"04","14","34","RYAN","No. Last night when I told you... You mentioned going to Berkeley."
"04","14","34","TAYLOR","God, I knew it. Ryan, yes, I applied to Berkeley months ago. Before you and I ever started dating."
"04","14","34","RYAN","Oh."
"04","14","34","TAYLOR","And then, this, you and I happened, and I thought, I don't know, maybe. And I guess I should have told you, but I really needed to know exactly how you felt first."
"04","14","34","RYAN","I just think our planning to go to college together, it's a big decision."
"04","14","34","TAYLOR","Would you have said you loved me if you'd known I'd gotten in to Berkeley? Great. Wow, okay. I'm just going to go."
"04","14","34","RYAN","Taylor."
"04","14","35","SUMMER","She's coming. Come on. This is where you blow out the candles and make a wish."
"04","14","35","TAYLOR","I'm sorry."
"04","14","36","SANDY","Don't worry. Kirsten and I will square up things here."
"04","14","36","RYAN","All right, great. Thanks. And I gave Seth the car to help carry the presents."
"04","14","36","SANDY","So where you going now?"
"04","14","36","RYAN","Uh, I don't know. I'll see you later."
"04","14","37","RYAN","Hey. You okay?"
"04","14","37","KAITLIN","Yeah. Sure. But by the looks of it, you and I aren't going to be brother and sister any time soon."
"04","14","37","RYAN","Oh, no. What happened?"
"04","14","37","KAITLIN","Honestly? It was me. I mean, look, Ryan, I have absolutely nothing against your dad. It's just I really didn't want to rush into an insta-family again. I mean, how long would this one last? Like a month?"
"04","14","37","RYAN","Well, you never know. I, uh, moved in with the Cohens and I gave it a week. Here I am."
"04","14","37","KAITLIN","I just wish there was a way you could tell if it was all going to work out."
"04","14","37","RYAN","Yeah, but there isn't. But I promise you, I will always be your brother, in a completely, non-creepy way."
"04","14","37","JULIE","Kaitlin, honey, could I talk to you?"
"04","14","37","KAITLIN","Yeah. Wait, Ryan, as your sister, if you don't tell Taylor that you love her, you're an idiot."
"04","14","37","RYAN","Oh."
"04","14","37","JULIE","She's right."
"04","14","38","SUMMER","Oh, no. Seth, I'm so sorry you had to overhear that."
"04","14","38","SETH","No, it's all right. I mean it's true."
"04","14","38","SUMMER","What I was going to say is, I think what you made is really good."
"04","14","38","SETH","Yeah, there's no coherent theme. Most of the shots are too wide and the Dogma thing has been done to death. But you know, I get that you wanted me to find something that I'm passionate about, the way you're passionate about the environment."
"04","14","38","SUMMER","But you love movies."
"04","14","38","SETH","I do. I love going to them and then telling people what's wrong with them."
"04","14","38","SUMMER","What is it?"
"04","14","38","SETH","I could be a critic."
"04","14","38","SUMMER","You mean spending your whole life watching movies and telling people how terrible they are?"
"04","14","38","SETH","Yeah, that sounds awesome."
"04","14","38","SUMMER","I just want you to find something that you really care about."
"04","14","38","SETH","You want to go rent An Inconvenient Truth?"
"04","14","38","SUMMER","Yes, I love that movie."
"04","14","38","SETH","I just want to count the number of gratuitously soulful shots of Al Gore staring out an airplane window."
"04","14","38","SUMMER","Do not insult Al Gore."
"04","14","39","KAITLIN","So what did you tell Frank?"
"04","14","39","JULIE","I told him we needed to slow it down."
"04","14","39","KAITLIN","Mom, if you really like him..."
"04","14","39","JULIE","I do. And he's not going away. But I told him that right now I need to be spending some time with my daughter."
"04","14","39","KAITLIN","Does that include buying me ice cream?"
"04","14","39","JULIE","Absolutely."
"04","14","40","TAYLOR","The hermit? My soul card's the hermit? Are you kidding me? Okay, Esmerelda, I'd better go. I guess I'll call you next year. Come in."
"04","14","40","RYAN","Hey, I hope I'm not interrupting."
"04","14","40","TAYLOR","No."
"04","14","40","RYAN","I got you something."
"04","14","40","TAYLOR","Okay... Wait, these are all poems that I've translated."
"04","14","40","RYAN","I collected them, recopied them, had them bound."
"04","14","40","TAYLOR","Ryan, this is amazing. Are you sure this is from you?"
"04","14","40","RYAN","Taylor, I'm sorry. I freaked out. What I said last night, I meant."
"04","14","40","TAYLOR","Really?"
"04","14","40","RYAN","I love you. And I don't want to lose you. So let's put it all on the table. Berkeley, Paris, Oxford, anything."
"04","14","40","TAYLOR","I don't know what to say."
"04","14","40","RYAN","That's a first."
"04","14","41","KAITLIN","Oh, my God, Mom."
"04","14","41","JULIE","It's okay, it's just... It's an earthquake. Get in here."
"04","14","41","KAITLIN","Mom!"
"04","15","0","TAYLOR","Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Ryan. Oh, my God."
"04","15","0","RYAN","It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's all right. Uh, okay, I'm going to count to three and you're going to get out of here, okay?"
"04","15","0","TAYLOR","No, no, no, you're goingto hurt yourself."
"04","15","0","RYAN","Don't have a choice. All right, one, two, three."
"04","15","0","TAYLOR","Okay, okay."
"04","15","0","RYAN","Go. Go, go, go, go."
"04","15","0","TAYLOR","Ryan Ryan? Are you okay?"
"04","15","0","RYAN","Yeah. Yeah. You?"
"04","15","0","TAYLOR","Yeah. I'm fine, thanks to you. Hey, Ryan?"
"04","15","0","RYAN","Mm-hmm."
"04","15","0","TAYLOR","I'm sorry I was all, ""Oh, my God, Oh, my God."" 'Cause usually I'm very good in a crisis. But I just started thinking about if anything happened to you and I don't know what I would do."
"04","15","0","RYAN","It's okay, we're both okay."
"04","15","0","TAYLOR","It's just that grace under fire is a very important quality and I don't want you to think that I'm lacking in it, because we might encounter all sorts of crisis when we're away together, like, at college. Oh, my God, is that blood? I faint at the sight of blood."
"04","15","0","RYAN","Oh, no, no, no, it's just glitter. Taylor. I'm okay. All that stuff we put on the table just now, let's, uh, let's talk about it later, okay?"
"04","15","0","TAYLOR","Right, yeah. That's probably a good idea, when, you know, the power's back on and we're not sitting in rubble."
"04","15","0","RYAN","Um, I'm going to call Kirsten and Sandy. Where's my jacket? Oh, gross. Sorry."
"04","15","0","TAYLOR","You know, I've actually stockpiled some rudimentary supplies in case of, you know, the Apocalypse or whatever. I got all sorts of stuff in there. Got extra tennis shoes and flashlights and canned goods and... A space heater..."
"04","15","0","RYAN","I'm not... Hey... getting good reception here. I'm going to step out in the hall."
"04","15","0","TAYLOR","Okay..."
"04","15","1","SANDY","So we got our marching orders and our staying put orders. So no one's to leave the plaza unless they have to."
"04","15","1","KIRSTEN","I can't get through to either of the boys."
"04","15","1","SANDY","Well, keep trying. How about you? We should get you to the hospital."
"04","15","1","KIRSTEN","I'm fine, it's just a bump on the head. Mine. Not his or hers. Ryan, where are you? They're at the Cooper house with Taylor."
"04","15","1","SANDY","Tell him to stay there."
"04","15","1","KIRSTEN","Okay. Just stay there, okay."
"04","15","1","SANDY","Seth?"
"04","15","1","SETH","Hey, Dad. Yeah, yeah, we're okay. I wish I could say the same for Ryan's car though. How's Mom? And Ryan? Ryan and Taylor are at your house. Yeah, sounds good, we'll do that. All right, take care."
"04","15","1","SUMMER","Found a flashlight."
"04","15","1","SETH","I can see that. Which is good, 'cause we can use it. We're going to have to get back to my house on foot. My dad thinks we should get off the streets."
"04","15","1","SUMMER","Why? Did he hear something? About aftershocks or looters or..."
"04","15","1","SETH","Zombies? I know, that was my first thought, too. But no, it's just a precaution. It's Ryan."
"04","15","1","SUMMER","Is everyone okay?"
"04","15","1","SETH","Yeah, we just have to make a little change of plans."
"04","15","2","SUMMER","Your dad said to go home."
"04","15","2","SETH","But I think we should all be together."
"04","15","2","SUMMER","This is a bad idea."
"04","15","2","SETH","We're almost there."
"04","15","2","SUMMER","No, we're not."
"04","15","2","SETH","It's just a few more minutes."
"04","15","2","SUMMER","Well, I know where my house is okay? Look, I command you to stop this bike. I'm sorry, okay but I'm starting to get a little creeped out. Not that I don't want to play Pictionary by candlelight and raid Taylor's Apocalypse kit, but I think we should just go to your house."
"04","15","2","SETH","Okay, but I'm still awaiting on news of Pancakes."
"04","15","2","SUMMER","Pancakes? You said Ryan said everyone was fine."
"04","15","2","SETH","I know, but I don't know that he included rodents in his head count, so I texted him to be sure."
"04","15","2","SUMMER","And?"
"04","15","2","SETH","And I'm still waiting on the reply."
"04","15","2","SUMMER","Maybe I should pedal. You look a little tired. Fine. Go!"
"04","15","3","JULIE","Frank, hi, it's Julie. I hope you're okay. Kaitlin and I are fine, I mean, we're trapped at the ice cream store on the pier, but we're fine. I guess help is probably on the way. Okay, well... take care, bye."
"04","15","3","KAITLIN","Look, I understand why you keep on calling Summer and the Cohens, but why Frank? I mean, weren't you guys supposed to take it down a notch?"
"04","15","3","JULIE","Kaitlin, just because we're pulling things back a little bit doesn't mean that we've stopped caring about each other. I'm sure wherever Frank is, he's worried about us, just like I am about him. And"
"04","15","3","KAITLIN","I am about myself, because we're stuck here with him."
"04","15","3","KAITLIN","Figures."
"04","15","3","JULIE","We can't just sit here waiting to be rescued."
"04","15","3","KAITLIN","Totally. No, we should start eating all the melting ice cream. I want a gold medal ribbon on a..."
"04","15","3","KAITLIN","Creepy, but convenient. Okay, ice-cream guy, start scooping."
"04","15","3","JULIE","Okay. I'm thinking the roof, or where the roof used to be. Ice-cream guy, got a ladder?"
"04","15","3","JULIE","I'm not going to, you are."
"04","15","4","TAYLOR","And this is my personal safety device. It's a flashlight, it's a radio, it's a cell phone charger, it's a siren and it's a compass. Hmm. North is that way."
"04","15","4","RYAN","Handy."
"04","15","4","TAYLOR","Also got canned goods, batteries, water, ooh, a gas mask and-- that's right-- North Korean currency, because you just never know. Hey, why are you wearing a jacket? Are you cold? Let me get my space blanket. It preserves up to 80% body heat."
"04","15","4","RYAN","No reason to think its anyone we know."
"04","15","4","TAYLOR","Yeah, of course not. Still, aren't families supposed to reach out to each other in times of uncertainty?"
"04","15","4","RYAN","I know the phones are messed up, but you were able to get through to Sandy and he was able to get through to Seth. Uh, right, you're worried about your mom."
"04","15","4","TAYLOR","Yeah. She gave birth to me. If I'm worried she may be hurt, then shouldn't she be worried about me? I think we need to go over there and check on her."
"04","15","4","RYAN","To her house?"
"04","15","4","TAYLOR","Yes, Ryan. I know my mom is a total bitch, but she's still my mom, and she doesn't drink a lot of milk so her bones are probably very brittle and she's always been kind of scared of the dark..."
"04","15","4","RYAN","Taylor, Taylor, we can't go over there. Seth and Summer are coming over here."
"04","15","4","TAYLOR","What? Since when?"
"04","15","4","RYAN","Since Seth texted me. He said that they were."
"04","15","4","TAYLOR","I thought Sandy said it was safest for us to stay where we are."
"04","15","4","RYAN","No, no, no, Sandy said that it's safer for all of us to be together."
"04","15","5","SANDY","All right, folks, we got to remain calm and we got to remain here. Anyone in need of medical attention, please identify yourself to this gentleman, and everyone who is willing to help anyone who might need it, please come over and introduce yourself to me. The good news is, we got everything we need here. We got shelter, we got food, we got water. We got fine literature, chips and salsa, so if we all stay together, we can get through this no problem. All right?"
"04","15","5","KIRSTEN","This is like Berkeley 1989."
"04","15","5","SANDY","Oh, you say that so warmly."
"04","15","5","KIRSTEN","Not that I'm fond of natural disasters, but there is nothing sexier than your husband calming an angry mob."
"04","15","5","SANDY","Now, are you okay?"
"04","15","5","KIRSTEN","Yeah, I know I've been complaining about Newport a lot lately, but it just breaks my heart to see it like this. I'm going to pass these out."
"04","15","5","SANDY","All right. Hello?"
"04","15","5","FRANK","Oh, hey, Sandy, I'm glad I finally got a hold of you. Are you with Ryan?"
"04","15","5","SANDY","Oh, no, Frank, but he's at the Cooper house with Taylor. He's fine, we're all fine."
"04","15","5","FRANK","That's great news. And Julie and Kaitlin, they're at the house too, right?"
"04","15","5","SANDY","That I don't know."
"04","15","5","FRANK","Do you have any idea where they might be?"
"04","15","5","SANDY","I'm sorry, I don't, but I'm sure they're going to try to get in touch with you, and if I hear anything at all, I'll call you."
"04","15","5","FRANK","I... yeah, yeah, thanks, Sandy. Great."
"04","15","6","JULIE","Okay, Gary, how's it look up there? Can you climb down and get some help?"
"04","15","6","JULIE","Why not? What's going on?"
"04","15","6","KAITLIN","Look, we appreciate the imagery and all that, but this is no time for existential metaphors."
"04","15","7","TAYLOR","Summer, you're okay!"
"04","15","7","SUMMER","I am so glad to see you."
"04","15","7","SETH","Hey, where's Ryan?"
"04","15","7","TAYLOR","He's..."
"04","15","7","RYAN","Hey."
"04","15","7","SUMMER","Hey, Atwood. I got to look for Pancakes."
"04","15","7","TAYLOR","Oh, my God! Pancakes! I'm gonna go with you."
"04","15","7","SETH","Great. While you guys do that, Ryan and I will, uh..."
"04","15","7","RYAN","Go."
"04","15","7","SETH","Yeah, we're gonna go."
"04","15","7","TAYLOR","Where are you gonna go?"
"04","15","7","SETH","Well, we need supplies."
"04","15","7","TAYLOR","I have supplies."
"04","15","7","RYAN","No, I know, but, uh, who knows how long those will last."
"04","15","7","SETH","Yeah, and there'll probably be a run, especially when the zombies come out."
"04","15","7","RYAN","Look, guys, we'll be fine. Just stay here, lock the doors and don't open them."
"04","15","7","SETH","Summer, Pancakes needs you right now."
"04","15","7","SUMMER","Be careful."
"04","15","7","SETH","'Kay, come back soon. Okay."
"04","15","7","RYAN","What's up?"
"04","15","8","TAYLOR","Don't you think the boys were acting weird?"
"04","15","8","SUMMER","The shifty looks, finishing eachother's sentences like they're composing a lie on the spot?"
"04","15","8","TAYLOR","Yes."
"04","15","8","SUMMER","Totally normal for them."
"04","15","8","TAYLOR","I don't know, I feel lik they're hiding something."
"04","15","8","SUMMER","If it's not the location of Pancakes, I'm not interested. Oh, no. He was in his cage. He's gone! Oh, no. Pancakes? Pancakes? Pancakes?"
"04","15","9","RYAN","Okay, I didn't want to worry Taylor. She's pretty upset, and she's got this thing about blood."
"04","15","9","SETH","Blood?"
"04","15","9","RYAN","Yeah. Don't freak, okay? I-I-I need you to not freak."
"04","15","9","SETH","Okay. Why would I freak out?"
"04","15","9","RYAN","It's not that bad, is it?"
"04","15","9","SETH","Dude, it's bad."
"04","15","10","RYAN","Seth, the hospital is, like, a mile away."
"04","15","10","SETH","I know, which is why I'm taking the secret back roads way that's only a half mile. That was sarcasm. I'm pretty sure my shortcut got us lost."
"04","15","10","RYAN","Well, the ocean's on one side, the land's on the other. I'm sure you'll figure it out. That was sarcasm, too. Sorry."
"04","15","10","SETH","No, hey, so you're a little on edge. A giant glass spear in the back will do that to a guy."
"04","15","10","RYAN","It's not a spear."
"04","15","10","SETH","What is it, more of a spike or a skewer?"
"04","15","10","RYAN","Dude, you're doing a terrible job of trying to keep my mind off the pain. You're supposed to talk about something else, not the thing causing the pain."
"04","15","10","SETH","True, but the real question is, what are you doing to keep my mind off of your pain? 'Cause right now you're not looking too good and I'm starting to feel... What was that?"
"04","15","10","RYAN","Uh, seems like we hit something."
"04","15","10","SETH","Oh, God, not a body."
"04","15","10","RYAN","All right, well, pull over or something. All right, go out and check, I guess."
"04","15","10","SETH","With the zombies?"
"04","15","10","RYAN","You watch way too many movies."
"04","15","11","JULIE","Uh, no. We're not."
"04","15","11","KAITLIN","No. It's just something we do."
"04","15","11","JULIE","I used to sing that to Kaitlin when she was little and scared."
"04","15","11","KAITLIN","Well, it was the only song she knew all the words to."
"04","15","11","JULIE","That and ""Pour Some Sugar on Me."""
"04","15","11","KAITLIN","No offense, Gary, but this is barely entertaining me."
"04","15","11","JULIE","Yeah, Gary, young guy in Newport, cool job... you must have a lot of fun."
"04","15","11","KAITLIN","No friends?"
"04","15","11","JULIE","No girls?"
"04","15","11","JULIE","Oh, well, you only need one, as long as it's a good one."
"04","15","11","KAITLIN","Well, are you guys serious?"
"04","15","11","JULIE","Oh, the next level. That's very serious."
"04","15","11","KAITLIN","Yeah, you haven't asked her out yet, have you?"
"04","15","11","KAITLIN","Well, what's the holdup? I mean, if she's as hot as she sounds."
"04","15","11","JULIE","Oh, what the hell; we have nothing better to do."
"04","15","11","KAITLIN","Yep, today is your lucky day."
"04","15","11","JULIE","Well, first, we have to get rid of that dorky bow tie."
"04","15","11","KAITLIN","Yeah, and an apron is friend to no man."
"04","15","11","JULIE","Surely we can do something with this hair. I think I have some nail scissors in my purse, hmm?"
"04","15","12","SETH","I can't get anyone on the phone."
"04","15","12","RYAN","Eh, that's okay, I'll, uh, I'll walk you through it. Just open up the back door. It's easy, don't worry about it."
"04","15","12","SETH","Ryan, you're asking me to use tools and exert myself physically. I think we both know where this is going."
"04","15","12","RYAN","Yeah, okay, well, uh, start by putting the jack under the frame by the, uh, by the door there. Yeah."
"04","15","12","SETH","The jack is this thing with the handle, right?"
"04","15","12","RYAN","Yeah. Actually, wait. First, um... loosen the bolts with that wrench. All right."
"04","15","12","SETH","There we go. Okay. All right, you may find this hard to believe, Ryan, but when I was younger, I used to be a bit of a worrier. You don't say. To distract myself from worrying, I would sometimes make lists. Didn't matter what the lists were. They could be anything-- every cereal I've ever eaten, or... uh, the names of every planet mentioned in Star Wars. Whatever."
"04","15","12","RYAN","Anyways... You want to make a list, Seth?"
"04","15","12","SETH","Huh? Oh, yeah, whatever. I mean, sure, if you want to. We could start with everyone you've ever punched in the face since moving to Newport. First would be... Luke at Holly's beach house."
"04","15","12","RYAN","Yeah, and number two would be Luke."
"04","15","12","SETH","Right. At the diner."
"04","15","12","RYAN","Yeah, and again at the mall."
"04","15","12","SETH","What about Holly's dad at Cotillion?"
"04","15","12","RYAN","That was more of a tackle."
"04","15","12","SETH","Which takes us back to Luke."
"04","15","12","RYAN","Yeah, in T.J."
"04","15","13","TAYLOR","Summer, do you really think Pancakes is in the attic? Like he pulled down the ladder, hopped up and-and then put it away?"
"04","15","13","SUMMER","Well, we have checked everywhere else. Light."
"04","15","13","TAYLOR","Be careful. Oh... gross."
"04","15","13","SUMMER","It's okay."
"04","15","13","TAYLOR","What is that?"
"04","15","13","SUMMER","That's Uncle Alistair."
"04","15","13","TAYLOR","That's your uncle?"
"04","15","13","SUMMER","Yeah. No. It's, uh, my dad's skeleton from med school. He called him Uncle Alistair. I don't know why."
"04","15","13","TAYLOR","God, well, I don't want to meet any of your other relatives, so let's just find Pancakes and go."
"04","15","13","SUMMER","Okay. Pancakes. Pancakes. Don't be afraid. It's just me."
"04","15","13","TAYLOR","Summer, you're such a good mother."
"04","15","13","SUMMER","Thanks."
"04","15","13","TAYLOR","When I think of the lengths that you're going to to save your adopted rabbit son, and my own mother can't even pick up the phoneand send me a text message saying, ""Hi. Are you alive?"""
"04","15","13","SUMMER","That's okay, you have us now. Seth and I rode on a bicycle just so we could be here together, and Julie and Kaitlin left a message and the Cohens asked about you."
"04","15","13","TAYLOR","Yeah, I know you're right."
"04","15","13","SUMMER","You know, if there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's you make your own family. It seems to me that you've scraped together quite an awesome one."
"04","15","13","TAYLOR","Wait."
"04","15","13","SUMMER","What?"
"04","15","13","TAYLOR","You hear that?"
"04","15","13","SUMMER","Where?"
"04","15","13","TAYLOR","In the vent."
"04","15","13","SUMMER","It's Pancakes. Pancakes? Pancakes? Here. Pancakes? Pancakes? Um, stay there, Pancakes. Let's pry this open. Okay. Pancakes? There he is!"
"04","15","13","TAYLOR","It's an aftershock-- it'll stop in a second."
"04","15","14","KAITLIN","Oh, my God."
"04","15","15","SANDY","Kirsten."
"04","15","15","KIRSTEN","Sandy. Something is not right. I could have lost the baby."
"04","15","16","SETH","Nothing works. It's like an information blackout."
"04","15","16","RYAN","Well, the aftershock probably took out a power line or something."
"04","15","16","SETH","So listen, I'm going to go on foot and get help, I think."
"04","15","16","RYAN","No, no, no."
"04","15","16","SETH","Well, we can't stay here. I don't even know where here is."
"04","15","16","RYAN","Well, I'm going with you."
"04","15","16","SETH","No, it's cool. Listen, I'm going to come back as soon as I can. Promise."
"04","15","16","RYAN","What about the zombies?"
"04","15","16","SETH","That's a really good point. Okay. All right, buddy. We have to keep you alert and on your feet. Now, when last we checked the list... Need some help?"
"04","15","16","RYAN","Yeah."
"04","15","16","SETH","...we were on Trey. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe we went from Trey to a lengthy Volchok period."
"04","15","16","RYAN","Hey, thanks for this."
"04","15","16","SETH","Yeah. Now, unless you hit that Chili guy or Johnny I know a lot of people were rooting for that."
"04","15","16","RYAN","Well, I did punch Johnny's dad. Or a bounty hunter who worked for him."
"04","15","16","SETH","Johnny's dad was a bounty hunter?"
"04","15","16","RYAN","Oh, yeah. I never told you that?"
"04","15","17","SANDY","Excuse me, Doctor. My wife needs to see someone right away."
"04","15","17","KIRSTEN","I fell down some stairs."
"04","15","17","KIRSTEN","I don't think so, but..."
"04","15","17","SANDY","She needs help."
"04","15","17","SANDY","She's pregnant."
"04","15","17","KIRSTEN","No, but something isn't... isn't right."
"04","15","17","SANDY","Hang on a second."
"04","15","17","KIRSTEN","Sandy..."
"04","15","17","SANDY","Hang on one second, all right? I'll be right back. Excuse me, Doctor. My wife would never complain. She would never put her needs in front of anybody else's. But I am not that proud. I am not that selfless. I am begging you,please, please, to give her and our baby priority."
"04","15","17","SANDY","Thank you. Honey."
"04","15","18","KAITLIN","Oh, great. We're out of candles, and now the ice cream is melted."
"04","15","18","JULIE","Honey, please. Stop worrying."
"04","15","18","KAITLIN","Stop worrying? We're about to be washed out to sea."
"04","15","18","JULIE","I'm sorry. You're right."
"04","15","18","KAITLIN","I'm... I'm right? I thought I was exaggerating."
"04","15","18","JULIE","I'm going up there."
"04","15","18","KAITLIN","To do what? To go swim out to shore?"
"04","15","18","JULIE","I don't know. Assess the situation... figure it out. I'm your mother. It's my job."
"04","15","18","JULIE","Why not?"
"04","15","18","JULIE","Oh, my... Oh, my God. Do you have an inhaler? Or like an Epi pen? I could stab you."
"04","15","18","KAITLIN","Really?"
"04","15","18","JULIE","That's good. That's good. That's good."
"04","15","18","KAITLIN","Okay, I think he needs, like, CPR or something. I learned this when I was in Junior Lifeguard. Oh! Gross! What the heck was the tongue for? He tried to kiss me!"
"04","15","18","JULIE","Young man, what is going on? Oh, my. The girl you like?"
"04","15","18","KAITLIN","Oh, you've got to be kidding me."
"04","15","19","TAYLOR","Pancakes!"
"04","15","19","SUMMER","I think I hear something this way."
"04","15","19","TAYLOR","Summer, how come we keep looking for Pancakes when there's a giant elephant in the room?"
"04","15","19","SUMMER","We walk around the elephant. It may be big, but we are crafty."
"04","15","19","TAYLOR","The boys should have been back over an hour ago. Aren't you worried?"
"04","15","19","SUMMER","No, I'm not worried. I'm freaking terrified, okay? That's why I'm focusing on just finding Pancakes and not about the fact that my boyfriend could be laying on the side of the road ravaged by zombies."
"04","15","19","TAYLOR","Okay, well, let's go look for them."
"04","15","19","SUMMER","In what? They took the only car. Have you thought of that?"
"04","15","19","TAYLOR","Well, let's listen to the radio and see if there's any news."
"04","15","19","SUMMER","The radio stopped working with the aftershock."
"04","15","19","TAYLOR","What was that?"
"04","15","19","SUMMER","Pancakes? Maybe it was Ryan and Seth."
"04","15","19","TAYLOR","Why would they need to break a window?"
"04","15","19","SUMMER","I don't know. What do we do? Quick, hide!"
"04","15","19","TAYLOR","Shh! No, no, no. Summer, wait. I've got a betteridea. Summer, come here."
"04","15","20","JULIE","You received a makeover under false pretenses."
"04","15","20","KAITLIN","You lied about having asthma."
"04","15","20","JULIE","Do you even like Bob Seger?"
"04","15","20","KAITLIN","I'm sorry."
"04","15","20","KAITLIN","I guess, I mean, that's understandable."
"04","15","20","JULIE","But what do you mean, you didn't want it to end? What the...?"
"04","15","20","KAITLIN","Mom..."
"04","15","20","JULIE","It's okay. Frank!"
"04","15","20","FRANK","Just got your message. I was so worried."
"04","15","20","JULIE","Oh, me, too!"
"04","15","20","KAITLIN","Go for it. There was a flipping earthquake."
"04","15","20","JULIE","But wait. How did you get here? What about the pier?"
"04","15","20","FRANK","What about it? The pier is fine."
"04","15","21","KIRSTEN","Thank God."
"04","15","21","SANDY","Can you treat that?"
"04","15","22","SETH","Okay, I've always wondered this. In your opinion, who is a better food industry server? Chloe, the magical waitress from Albuquerque, or Donny, the angry busboy who shot Luke?"
"04","15","22","RYAN","I'll go with Chloe on that one."
"04","15","22","SETH","Good. That's what I figured. That's what I figured. Okay. Okay. Desert island. Sadie, the tough as nails yet soulful jewelry maker or Lindsay, my grandfather's illegitimate, bookish love child?"
"04","15","22","RYAN","I can't, Seth."
"04","15","22","SETH","Sure... sure you can. It's very easy."
"04","15","22","RYAN","Go on. Just go."
"04","15","22","SETH","I'm not going to go alone."
"04","15","22","RYAN","We need help, man. I need help. Just sit me down, okay?"
"04","15","22","SETH","All right. Okay, but I'm going to come right back."
"04","15","22","RYAN","I know."
"04","15","23","SUMMER","Do you hear that?"
"04","15","23","TAYLOR","No."
"04","15","23","SUMMER","Exactly. It's quiet now. Maybe they moved on."
"04","15","23","TAYLOR","Or... maybe they're just faking us out. There we go. Locked and loaded. Just how mama likes it."
"04","15","23","SUMMER","Taylor, a gun? Where did you get that? Are you crazy?"
"04","15","23","TAYLOR","It's Jimmy Cooper's flare gun. I found it in the hall closet when I was looking for rain gear."
"04","15","23","TAYLOR","Well, this was last November. What? Jimmy doesn't need it anymore, and it's cold, and it's shiny, and it feels so good in my... Here. You try it."
"04","15","23","SUMMER","Eww! I'm not touching your pistol. That is stupid and dangerous. Oh, my God. Go 187 on that zombie ass."
"04","15","23","TAYLOR","It's in the kitchen. Follow me. Stop or I'll shoot!"
"04","15","23","TAYLOR","Mom?"
"04","15","24","TAYLOR","I know, Mom, and it really means a lot to me that you did."
"04","15","24","TAYLOR","It was just a toe nick. You're totally fine."
"04","15","24","TAYLOR","I already told you, there's no way to get you to the hospital. You're just going to have to tough it out!"
"04","15","24","SUMMER","Pancakes is hurt!"
"04","15","24","SUMMER","I found him in the garage, and he was limping."
"04","15","24","TAYLOR","Let me see. Careful. Baby, come here. Let me see. You know, he seems like he's okay. Maybe it's just a sprain."
"04","15","24","SUMMER","No, I can't take a chance, okay? I have to go get him help."
"04","15","24","TAYLOR","Summer, you can't. It's too dangerous."
"04","15","24","SUMMER","I cannot wait here any longer, okay? I have a missing boyfriend and a sick rabbit. I cannot listen to any more of your mother's whining."
"04","15","24","TAYLOR","Okay, I'll go with you. We'll brave the zombies together. Mom, we're going to need to take Pancakes to the hospital."
"04","15","24","TAYLOR","We don't have a car, you can't walk. There is no way to get you there."
"04","15","24","SUMMER","I have an idea, but I don't think you're going to like it."
"04","15","25","SUMMER","Well, I told you you wouldn't like it."
"04","15","25","TAYLOR","Mom, it's not that far to the hospital, and it's kind of this or nothing."
"04","15","25","SUMMER","I'll carry Pancakes."
"04","15","26","KAITLIN","I heard you, you're sorry. I get it."
"04","15","26","KAITLIN","Gary..."
"04","15","26","JULIE","Kaitlin, honey, you coming?"
"04","15","26","KAITLIN","Oh, yeah, just give me one second."
"04","15","26","JULIE","Okay, we'll wait for you in the car."
"04","15","26","KAITLIN","Look, I should go. But I am into ice cream, and you're obviously hooked up as far as that goes. And the makeover was pretty successful. And the asthma attack had me completely fooled."
"04","15","26","KAITLIN","So I guess once you guys get this place back up and running, I'll come stop by."
"04","15","27","SANDY","Dr. Harris, are those my wife's tests?"
"04","15","27","SANDY","Oh, of course, it's just a little bit too soon for that. I know you have your hands full."
"04","15","27","SANDY","Well, as soon as you know anything, you know, good or bad... if you could please let me know."
"04","15","27","SANDY","I mean, it's kind of crazy in that we have two other boys that are just going off to college, so we were expecting to have an empty nest, you know, when then, all of a sudden, this unplanned, miraculous event and, well, uh, the fact of the matter is, I can't imagine anything worse than an empty nest so, uh... Anything you can do for that, uh, for that little baby, please, do it. I'll get out of your hair right now, okay?"
"04","15","27","SANDY","I'll be right there, all right?"
"04","15","27","SANDY","Yes, of course."
"04","15","28","SETH","Darryl?"
"04","15","28","SETH","Uh, not too well. I need to ask for your help."
"04","15","28","SETH","Well, I'm guessing you don't have a, uh, like, a car or a walkie-talkie?"
"04","15","28","SETH","Okay, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you for it."
"04","15","28","SETH","No, no, they look better on you. Listen. It has a flat tire and possibly a broken axle, but it's a $70,000 car and it's all yours in exchange for the cart."
"04","15","28","SETH","Stay here, I'll come back to draw you a map."
"04","15","29","SUMMER","It's a he, and I'm aware of his species. but that doesn't mean that he doesn't feel pain and that he isn't hurt. Please, if you have a shred of humanity, or animality in your body, you won't deprive this poor, little, adorable bunny of quality medical care."
"04","15","29","SUMMER","Really?"
"04","15","29","SUMMER","Thank you. Thank you."
"04","15","30","JULIE","I still can't believe that guy kept us there for no reason."
"04","15","30","FRANK","I don't know. I think his reasons are pretty good. When a guy gets around a girl he's crazy about, sometimes reason goes out the window. He forgets to take things slow."
"04","15","30","KAITLIN","Well, sometimes, when a girl gets around a guy she's not too crazy about, she does some pretty stupid things, too. I'm sorry for posting your mug shot up in the ladies' room at Taylor's birthday."
"04","15","30","FRANK","Well, it showed a lot of creativity."
"04","15","30","JULIE","Speaking of creativity, Kaitlin... clown p0rn?"
"04","15","30","FRANK","I'm not even going to ask where that came from."
"04","15","30","KAITLIN","I found it in Dr. Robert's study. You guys will believe absolutely anything. Hey, Frank, have you ever considered cutting your hair?"
"04","15","30","JULIE","Is that Seth?"
"04","15","30","KAITLIN","Oh, my God, pull over."
"04","15","31","TAYLOR","Mom, I'm really sorry I shot you. I know we don't always get along, but... I really love you."
"04","15","31","TAYLOR","I... don't think I've ever heard you say that before."
"04","15","31","TAYLOR","Oh, my God, Mom, me, too."
"04","15","31","TAYLOR","But you did. So..."
"04","15","31","TAYLOR","Mom..."
"04","15","32","SETH","Hi. I guess this is the point where I'm supposed to tell you that you gave us all quite a scare, except I was never scared."
"04","15","32","RYAN","Oh, yeah, I know that. Me, on the other hand..."
"04","15","32","SETH","The doctors say you're going to be fine. Although you're going to have to wrap your head around the fact that we're really brothers now. We're blood brothers."
"04","15","32","RYAN","You donated blood?"
"04","15","32","SETH","Ah, I had an extra few pints flowing through my veins. It was no big deal."
"04","15","32","RYAN","You're not a big fan of needles."
"04","15","32","SETH","Nor of fainting, it turns out. But the bank was a little low and us O-negative guys got to stick together."
"04","15","32","RYAN","That's weird, 'cause all of a sudden I have this strange urge to listen to Death Cab and read comic books."
"04","15","32","SETH","Really?"
"04","15","32","RYAN","No, I'm kidding."
"04","15","32","SETH","Oh, that's too bad, 'cause if we could have turned this into a body-swap comedy, we could have squeezed another year or two out of this."
"04","15","32","RYAN","So listen, I don't know if I've said this at all today, but..."
"04","15","32","SETH","You did. But after all the times you've saved me, I was up, so..."
"04","15","32","RYAN","All right. Where's everyone else? How are, how are the girls? Kirsten, Sandy?"
"04","15","32","SETH","Uh, the girls are fine. Veronica Townsend and Pancakes, however, have matching casts. And Frank is here with Julie and Kaitlin. He gave me a ride, brought you here. Um, but my mom and dad are doing some tests with the doctor, 'cause she fell."
"04","15","32","RYAN","Is it bad?"
"04","15","32","SANDY","Hey, boys."
"04","15","32","SETH","Mom."
"04","15","32","RYAN","I'm so sorry."
"04","15","32","KIRSTEN","Everything's fine. The baby's okay. She's okay."
"04","15","32","SETH","She?"
"04","15","32","SANDY","It's a girl."
"04","15","34","SANDY","Well, looks like the old girl held up pretty good."
"04","15","34","KIRSTEN","I can't wait to have a hot shower with the hot water we don't have."
"04","15","34","RYAN","I'll settle for sleeping in my own bed."
"04","15","34","SETH","Or sleeping anywhere."
"04","15","34","SANDY","Come on, I'll fire up the grill, we'll get the camp stove going, it'll be fun. Oh my God !"
"04","16","0","SANDY","Eggs..."
"04","16","0","RYAN","And flour. There we go."
"04","16","0","SANDY","Milk."
"04","16","0","KAITLIN","Okay, now, Ryan, fire up the griddle. And Sandy, beat until smooth."
"04","16","0","SANDY","Hey, Mama, have a seat. In the mood for crêpes?"
"04","16","0","KIRSTEN","You're making crêpes?"
"04","16","0","RYAN","Yeah! Taylor sent Kaitlin a griddle from France."
"04","16","0","KAITLIN","With a super-long note about how I need to broaden my breakfast horizons. She's 6,000 miles away and still annoying."
"04","16","0","KIRSTEN","Ryan, have you talked to her?"
"04","16","0","RYAN","Oh, no. Haven't read her blog, haven't looked at her scrapbook. It's over and I'm okay. It's been months. I barely even think about her."
"04","16","0","SANDY","Even though you're living in her room."
"04","16","0","RYAN","You know, we've all had to make adjustments since the earthquake."
"04","16","0","KIRSTEN","Especially Kaitlin, with the entire Cohen family taking refuge here."
"04","16","0","KAITLIN","No, it's been nice. I mean, I've perfected my Sandy Cohen. Listen to this. I'll schmear it for ya."
"04","16","0","SANDY","Well, you know, not bad. I am very sexy."
"04","16","0","JULIE","Baby, stop mimicking Sandy."
"04","16","0","SANDY","Julie! Crêpe?"
"04","16","0","JULIE","I think I'm too nauseous to eat."
"04","16","0","KIRSTEN","Morning sickness ?"
"04","16","0","JULIE","Or wedding jitters. Who can tell?"
"04","16","0","KIRSTEN","Well, your fiancé is certainly excited about the nuptials. Yeah, he's kind of become a broken record over and over again. He keeps saying..."
"04","16","0","GORDON","Bang! Hey, Sandy."
"04","16","0","SANDY","Bullit."
"04","16","0","GORDON","Ryan. Peanut. Hey, Blondie. And there she is, the future Mrs. Gordon Bullit."
"04","16","0","KIRSTEN","Well, wedding days can be nerve-wracking, but just think, after tomorrow you will be just another old married couple."
"04","16","0","JULIE","Just like that one living upstairs."
"04","16","1","SETH","Hey, breakfast time."
"04","16","1","SUMMER","Toaster strudel! Oh, you're the best cook ever."
"04","16","1","SETH","Shh, enough talking, what do you want to watch?"
"04","16","1","SUMMER","Oh, I think you know what I want to watch."
"04","16","1","SETH","The premise is so simple."
"04","16","1","SUMMER","Yet so compelling."
"04","16","1","SANDY","Can I come in?"
"04","16","1","SETH","Hey, sure."
"04","16","1","SANDY","I know you don't like to leave your lair, but the inspector is coming to the house today. I think everybody should be there."
"04","16","1","SETH","But this chair is my home now."
"04","16","1","SANDY","Downstairs in ten minutes."
"04","16","2","SANDY","Boy, his body language is very negative."
"04","16","2","KIRSTEN","You think?"
"04","16","2","RYAN","Wait, he just smiled."
"04","16","2","SETH","I think it was more of a smirk."
"04","16","2","KIRSTEN","Everyone keep your fingers crossed."
"04","16","2","SANDY","So what's the good news? When can we rebuild?"
"04","16","2","RYAN","Excuse me?"
"04","16","2","SETH","But Dad, we can pay to fix it, right?"
"04","16","2","SANDY","Yeah, we've got insurance, savings."
"04","16","3","RYAN","Nice view, infinity pool..."
"04","16","3","RYAN","Yes, well, six bedrooms. I think there's room enough for everyone."
"04","16","3","SANDY","Yeah, but it still just doesn't feel like home. You know, maybe I'm not ready to leave the old place yet."
"04","16","3","RYAN","I'm going to miss it. Doesn't mean I'm not looking forward to Berkeley."
"04","16","3","SANDY","Oh, Berkeley. Now, there was a house. The minute we walked in the front door, we knew we were home. Wood floors, exposed beams, that house had character."
"04","16","3","KIRSTEN","And this house has none of those things."
"04","16","3","KIRSTEN","It's average and generic."
"04","16","3","SANDY","I couldn't agree with you more. Let's get out of here."
"04","16","3","KIRSTEN","I think we should make an offer."
"04","16","3","SANDY","You do?"
"04","16","3","KIRSTEN","Well, we've seen five versions of the same house. Does it really matter which one we pick?"
"04","16","3","SANDY","Whatever you want, honey."
"04","16","4","SETH","It's hard to believe that soon all this will be gone. Take a good look around. Everything is about to change."
"04","16","4","SUMMER","Actually, I have a surprise. Look. The floor plan to ourapartment in Providence."
"04","16","4","SETH","Hey, big-screen TV, La-Z-Boys, hot plate. It looks exactly like here. Awesome. Do you think our TiVo will keep its memory if we pack it?"
"04","16","4","SUMMER","I don't know. I should callthe help line right now. Oh..."
"04","16","4","SETH","What?"
"04","16","4","SUMMER","Nothing. You know, I think I'm going to call later when there's less phone traffic in India."
"04","16","4","SETH","What? Isn't it awesome we get to live like this for the next four years?"
"04","16","4","SUMMER","Mm-hmm. Okay, got to run. Hey, Atwood."
"04","16","4","RYAN","Hey."
"04","16","4","SETH","Ryan. Come in. Sit."
"04","16","4","RYAN","Yeah, not going to happen. But I do need your help with a plan."
"04","16","4","SETH","Does it involve leaving this room?"
"04","16","4","RYAN","It involves leaving the city."
"04","16","5","TAYLOR","That is an excellent question, sir. The answer to which I spent the better part of my trans-Atlantic flight trying to determine. Because it's not business, but it's not pleasure. Because that would imply that seeing Ryan Atwood again is pleasurable, when really, all it is is stressful and... you know, really kind of surreal that we ever dated in the first place. Because it's not like we have anything in common. You know, not that we didn't try though, because we really did. Like I stopped wearing shoes and learned hacky sack in an effort to fit in at Berkeley, and then he learned French and learned to appreciate the difference between a Brie and a Camemburt And then he grew this little mustache in an effort to appear more French-like, but you know, he's fair-haired, and it was really just kind of an above-lip disaster. And from there we just realized it didn't work, you know. We didn't work and I left, to escape the painful reality of yet another failed relationship and at least this time I didn't stalk him though. Because sometimes I do that. Good thing I never fell in lovewith the president, huh?"
"04","16","5","TAYLOR","Right."
"04","16","6","TAYLOR","Summer!"
"04","16","6","SUMMER","Hey, Taylor. So good to see you."
"04","16","6","TAYLOR","Oh, you, too. Did you come alone?"
"04","16","6","SUMMER","Ryan doesn't know that you're coming. You told me not to tell him."
"04","16","6","TAYLOR","Who said anything about Ryan? We're so over. I just, I can't even believe we ever even dated, you know? I don't even think I would recognize him. You know, I just hope he shaved that mustache."
"04","16","7","SETH","Did you get a rental car?"
"04","16","7","RYAN","Yeah. You got the address?"
"04","16","7","TAYLOR","Ryan, hi. You found out I was coming and decided to surprise me?"
"04","16","7","RYAN","No, I didn't know you were coming back and I'm leaving."
"04","16","7","SUMMER","Oh, well, now I'm surprised. Where are you guys going?"
"04","16","7","RYAN","Oh, not far. We'll be back by tonight."
"04","16","7","SETH","Yeah, it's a mission. I'm going to call you."
"04","16","7","TAYLOR","Okay, well, brilliant catching up."
"04","16","7","RYAN","It's good to see you."
"04","16","8","SETH","That wasn't awkward at all."
"04","16","8","RYAN","No, no, why would it be? It's not like I'm still in love with her or anything."
"04","16","9","SUMMER","Taylor, are you okay?"
"04","16","9","TAYLOR","No, I'm not. I'm still in love with him."
"04","16","10","KAITLIN","I can't believe the Bullit's got 12 sons."
"04","16","10","KAITLIN","I mean, I've always wanted brothers and now I'm going to have a dozen. I mean, it'll be cool, if they're all like you."
"04","16","10","GORDON","Oh, there she is. Bullits, meet the Squirt."
"04","16","10","GORDON","Squirt, meet the Bullits. This is Austin, Dallas, Houston, Lubbock, Odessa, El Paso, Amarillo, Texarkana, San Antonio, Corpus Christi and Hanoi."
"04","16","10","KAITLIN","Wow. Okay."
"04","16","10","GORDON","Ain't that something? Now you got yourself a whole buffet of Bullits to love."
"04","16","10","KAITLIN","Wow. Well, I guess the apple really doesn't fall far from the tree."
"04","16","10","GORDON","Oh, not my apples. The Bullit's DNA is bulletproof. Not a recessive gene in the whole damn double helix. Oh, looky here, the wife-to-be. What's the word, sweetie?"
"04","16","10","JULIE","It's a boy."
"04","16","10","GORDON","Lucky number 13, yes!"
"04","16","11","RYAN","This is it."
"04","16","11","SETH","The Berkeley House."
"04","16","11","RYAN","Yeah, exactly how Sandy described it. You ready for this? Hello. So we'd like to buy your house."
"04","16","12","SETH","Please don't shut the door."
"04","16","12","RYAN","We should tell them everything."
"04","16","12","SETH","Okay, right. Uh, this is my house."
"04","16","12","SETH","No, no, he means it used to be his house. Yeah, those baby handprints in the cement, those, those are mine."
"04","16","12","SETH","I know, thank you. Anyway, my parents moved us to Newport when I was two, which was a mistake on many levels, but it did allow us to adopt a young ex-convict named Ryan."
"04","16","12","RYAN","I'm not actually a convict."
"04","16","12","SETH","Right. Now our house is condemned due to an earthquake. My mom's about to have another baby, and I feel like there's this chance for our family to have a fresh start."
"04","16","12","RYAN","Yeah, his parents are always talking about the time they spent here being the best of their lives. It'd be like coming home."
"04","16","12","SETH","I thought I had them with the hands in the cement thing."
"04","16","12","RYAN","Me, too. We should call your dad."
"04","16","12","SETH","Sure, nobody can change somebody's mind like my dad, but he's not going to leave my mom, and the airlines won't let women fly in their ninth month of pregnancy."
"04","16","12","RYAN","What if she didn't flyon an airline?"
"04","16","13","SANDY","Well, we'll live there a year, get settled with the baby, and then we can look for a housewithout feeling rushed."
"04","16","13","KIRSTEN","And I know we can't impose on Julie much longer. I just wish..."
"04","16","13","SANDY","Oh, me, too. But wherever our family is, that's home."
"04","16","13","GORDON","Drop that pen, amigo! I'm kidnapping the both of you. Come on. The jet is gassed up."
"04","16","13","KIRSTEN","Is he drunk?"
"04","16","13","GORDON","No. Your boys called. They're up in Berkeley trying to buy back the old homestead. Just need you two up there to seal the deal. I figured the least I could do is lend my jet, since old Sanford here introduced me to my lady love."
"04","16","13","KIRSTEN","I can't fly. I'm nine-months pregnant."
"04","16","13","GORDON","Oh, my son Amarillo, he's waiting at the plane. He's one of those doctors for women's private parts. Come on, sunshine's burning. Let's go."
"04","16","13","GORDON","Oh, what the hell, blondie, I'll buy this house. There you go. There you go."
"04","16","14","TAYLOR","I'm not saying things will just snap back to how they were, but maybe we were too quick to give up. So we'll be 6,000 miles away. I'll be in Newport for Christmas and the summer, and you know, we'll make it work. I should call him, don't you think?"
"04","16","14","SUMMER","Oh, real-life Jake broke up with real-life April."
"04","16","14","TAYLOR","What are you doing?"
"04","16","14","SUMMER","I told Seth that I wouldn't watch Briefcase or No Briefcase till he got home, so I'm reading about The Valley."
"04","16","14","TAYLOR","Oh, my God, that show's still on?"
"04","16","14","SUMMER","It just got picked up for five more seasons. You know, these teen dramas, they just run forever."
"04","16","14","TAYLOR","Okay, enough, this is insane."
"04","16","14","SUMMER","Hey!"
"04","16","14","TAYLOR","Summer, when I left, you were a committed environmentalist. You were passionate. You engaged with the world. You... bathed."
"04","16","14","SUMMER","I still care about things."
"04","16","14","TAYLOR","Like what? Besides Briefcase or No Briefcase and the starsof The Valley? Sweetie, tell me what happened."
"04","16","14","SUMMER","I don't know. Well, the earthquake happened, then the comic bookstore closed down, and Seth's room was destroyed. I didn't join GEORGE, and then he moved in. We talked about everything there was to talk about. Then one day we turned on the TV. And there it was. Briefcase or No Briefcase. And suddenly, we weren't worried about the future. We weren't wondering who we were. For the first time, I think we were really comfortable."
"04","16","14","TAYLOR","Maybe a little too comfortable. You ever think about that?"
"04","16","14","SUMMER","No."
"04","16","14","TAYLOR","Oh, my God, what is that?"
"04","16","14","SUMMER","I don't know. Pancakes had babies! When did this happen?!"
"04","16","14","TAYLOR","You didn't know she was pregnant?"
"04","16","14","SUMMER","I didn't he was a she. Oh, my God, I'm a bad crack mother."
"04","16","15","RYAN","Shouldn't we be waiting at the house?"
"04","16","15","SETH","Uh, we've got a little bit of time until the Bullit is wheels down with our parents. Take a look around, man. In a few weeks, you're going to have all these new faces to punch."
"04","16","15","RYAN","Aw, you getting nostalgic on me?"
"04","16","15","SETH","No. Seriously, everyone's moving. Newport's over. This is the future. And it's also possible you may meet another Taylor Townsend. What was that? There is no other Taylor Townsend? There's only one and you're in love with her? All right. Listen, you haven't said a word since we bumped into her. I know it means you can't stop thinking about her. I'm going to get some coffee."
"04","16","15","SETH","You love her, I know it."
"04","16","15","RYAN","Stop it."
"04","16","15","SETH","I know it!"
"04","16","15","SETH","Hey, are you Paul from GEORGE.?"
"04","16","15","SETH","Uh, no, my girlfriend Summer Roberts met him."
"04","16","15","SETH","Uh, not much of anything, really."
"04","16","15","SETH","Yeah. She... she loves otters. Thank you."
"04","16","16","RYAN","Hello."
"04","16","16","TAYLOR","Ryan, hi, it's me."
"04","16","16","RYAN","Oh, hey."
"04","16","16","SUMMER","Ouch, this soap stings!"
"04","16","16","TAYLOR","Well, that's because it's lye. Sorry. So I was, um, thinking maybe we should get together and talk about things."
"04","16","16","RYAN","Oh, uh..."
"04","16","16","SUMMER","But you don't want to?"
"04","16","16","RYAN","No, no, it's just I don't know when Seth and I are going to get back from Berkeley."
"04","16","16","TAYLOR","Oh. Why are you in Berkeley?"
"04","16","16","RYAN","Long story, but basically trying to get the Cohens their old house back."
"04","16","16","TAYLOR","The Cohens are moving to Berkeley?"
"04","16","16","RYAN","If things work out."
"04","16","16","TAYLOR","So, that would mean you wouldn't be coming back to Newport for Christmas or summer or... ever."
"04","16","16","RYAN","I guess not. Um, listen, we could talk after the wedding if you want."
"04","16","16","TAYLOR","Yeah, oh, yeah, I have to go. Um, you have a nice trip."
"04","16","17","JULIE","We finish this and then we're done. Unless there's anything else you need for tomorrow."
"04","16","17","KAITLIN","I'm all good. I've got my shoes, my dress, my cheat sheet with the names of all my stepbrothers."
"04","16","17","JULIE","How was that, meeting all of them?"
"04","16","17","KAITLIN","Weird, but I mean, I love Bullit, but one's kind of enough, you know?"
"04","16","17","JULIE","You're telling me."
"04","16","17","KAITLIN","What are you talking about? You're about to spawn off the latest."
"04","16","17","JULIE","Well, maybe he won't be all that Bullit-esque."
"04","16","17","KAITLIN","Don't count on it. He's probably going to come out with a cowboy hat telling the doctor, ""Bang."" Or a wife-beater."
"04","16","17","JULIE","Why would he be wearing a wife-beater?"
"04","16","17","KAITLIN","Oh, my God. Mom..."
"04","16","17","JULIE","Okay, honey, just relax."
"04","16","17","KAITLIN","You have to be kidding me. I mean, does the Bullit know?"
"04","16","17","JULIE","Of course he knows."
"04","16","17","KAITLIN","What, you told him that the baby is..."
"04","16","17","JULIE","Frank's, yes."
"04","16","17","KAITLIN","And when were you going to tell me?"
"04","16","17","JULIE","Soon. I'm sorry. This isn't easy."
"04","16","17","KAITLIN","Well, what happened with you and Frank?"
"04","16","17","JULIE","I got pregnant, and Frank couldn't deal with it, so I left him. That's when the Bullit came back, I told him everything, and he still wanted to marry me. That's the whole story."
"04","16","17","KAITLIN","Mom, do you love the Bullit?"
"04","16","17","JULIE","Yes."
"04","16","18","SANDY","I can't believe we're here. Seriously, fellas, this is crazy."
"04","16","18","SETH","You always said this was where you guys were the happiest."
"04","16","18","RYAN","Every city needs public defenders."
"04","16","18","SETH","Plus, I think my little sister deserves a shot at growing up normal."
"04","16","18","KIRSTEN","Well, we can at least talk to them."
"04","16","18","SANDY","Can't hurt."
"04","16","19","SANDY","Hello. I'm Sandy Cohen. This is my wife, Kirsten. and we used to live here."
"04","16","19","SANDY","You don't want to sell, I get it, but just beinghere again, I got to say it still feels like home."
"04","16","19","KIRSTEN","Um, is the bathroom still in the same place? Do you mind?"
"04","16","19","KIRSTEN","Thank you."
"04","16","19","SANDY","I love what you've done with the decorating. Is there any chance we could see the kitchen? Just to see if the Seth Cohen growth chart is still notched in the wall?"
"04","16","19","SETH","Oh, I hit three feet. I mean, it was a pretty huge accomplishment."
"04","16","19","SANDY","No, it's all right. We'll be out of here in just a sec."
"04","16","19","KIRSTEN","Oh, God! Sandy!"
"04","16","19","SANDY","Or not."
"04","16","19","KIRSTEN","Sandy!"
"04","16","19","SANDY","I'm here."
"04","16","19","KIRSTEN","Oh, my God."
"04","16","19","KIRSTEN","I'm sorry, I didn't make it."
"04","16","19","KIRSTEN","My water broke."
"04","16","19","SANDY","Seth, call an ambulance!"
"04","16","19","KIRSTEN","There's no time for an ambulance."
"04","16","20","SANDY","Sophie Rose Cohen. Aw... It's got a nice ring to it, huh?"
"04","16","20","KIRSTEN","She's beautiful, isn't she?"
"04","16","20","SETH","She really will be in two years when she doesn't look like a squished meatball."
"04","16","20","RYAN","You just called your sister a squished meatball."
"04","16","20","SANDY","You should have seen what you looked like when you were born."
"04","16","20","KIRSTEN","Oh, he was beautiful, too."
"04","16","20","SANDY","Yeah, I was."
"04","16","20","SANDY","Yeah, you looked like you went 12 rounds with Joe Frasier."
"04","16","20","SETH","Oh, she's going to..."
"04","16","20","RYAN","Yeah, we should go."
"04","16","20","GORDON","No, thank you, Kirsten, I'm lactose intolerant."
"04","16","20","SANDY","Bullit, what are you doing here? Aren't you getting married in a few hours?"
"04","16","20","GORDON","Don't I know it. Couldn't get any damn airspace. All those dot commers up here with their private jets. The runway was busier than a bull in springtime. It's fine now."
"04","16","20","SANDY","Hey, thanks for everything."
"04","16","20","KIRSTEN","Give Julie our best and please explain why we couldn't make it."
"04","16","20","GORDON","Oh, I will, and she'll be thrilled. And when she pops out lucky number 13, bang, I want you there."
"04","16","20","SANDY","Sophie Rose Cohen."
"04","16","21","KAITLIN","Kaitlin, what are you doing here?"
"04","16","21","KAITLIN","Just wondering if you've got an invite to the wedding, 'cause you didn't RSVP, which is really rude, considering my mom's pregnant with your baby."
"04","16","21","FRANK","So she told you, huh?"
"04","16","21","KAITLIN","How could you do that... just walk away from her? I mean, she loved you."
"04","16","21","FRANK","When she told me she was pregnant, I did kind of panic, and I know I let her down. But when I went to see her and tell her that, she was having dinner with Bullit. For what it's worth, I really do love her, but she's made her choice. I know better than to try and change your mom's mind."
"04","16","21","KAITLIN","So you're just quitting?"
"04","16","21","FRANK","Whoa, wait a minute. Isn't this what you wanted? Bullit and a new family?"
"04","16","21","KAITLIN","All I want is for my mom to be happy. and for my little brother to have his dad around, but not if he's going to be a coward. You know, I thought Atwood were good at fighting."
"04","16","22","SETH","Is Mom sleeping?"
"04","16","22","SANDY","Mother and daughter are snoring soundly."
"04","16","22","SETH","How you feeling?"
"04","16","22","SANDY","Like I landed in a time warp; your mother, me, a new baby and this house. It's almost20 years later and I feel like no time has passed at all."
"04","16","22","SETH","Well, you look like it, too. You got that full head of hair. If I look half as good as you in 20 years, I'll be a happy man."
"04","16","22","SANDY","Well, thanks, but I'd like to see you being happy right now. Seems the last couple of months you've landed in a bit of a rut. At least a La-Z-Boy."
"04","16","22","SETH","Well, I sort of have, but being up here and seeing Ryan's new life and meeting my new sister... I get that change is happening whether I want it to or not."
"04","16","22","SANDY","Yeah, nothing lasts forever. But you and Summer still have each other. You'll be heading off to Providence together."
"04","16","22","SETH","Yeah. Except I'm not so sure that us being together is bringing out best in either one of us right now. But I'm afraid to let her go, so..."
"04","16","22","SANDY","Well, things have a way of coming back around. Look at us."
"04","16","23","SUMMER","Maybe I should go try to find Julie and see if she needs any help."
"04","16","23","TAYLOR","Sure, Summer, just abandon me, too. Maybe I'll just strike up a casual romance with one of the Bullits. Okay, who do you think's hotter, El Paso or San Antonio?"
"04","16","23","SUMMER","Yeah, I'm going to have to think about that."
"04","16","23","TAYLOR","Hanoi has a certain charm."
"04","16","24","JULIE","Thanks for filling in for Kirsten. I hope she shows up soon."
"04","16","24","SUMMER","You look so beautiful."
"04","16","24","JULIE","Thank you. And you, it's nice to see you looking so... showered again."
"04","16","24","SUMMER","Hmm, well, I figured it was about time."
"04","16","24","JULIE","Yeah. Is everything okay?"
"04","16","24","SUMMER","I guess. I don't know, you're with the same someone for so long... I guess you start to get a little comfortable."
"04","16","24","JULIE","I wouldn't know."
"04","16","24","SUMMER","Do you think that Seth and I are making a mistake? Living together right after the earthquake, and then getting an apartment together next year in Providence?"
"04","16","24","JULIE","Uh, well, you know... I got married so young that I never had a chance to find out who I was or what I cared about. I mean, I never went to college or learned any real skills. And now here I am 20 years later, still knocked up on my wedding day."
"04","16","24","SUMMER","Julie."
"04","16","24","JULIE","Summer... you're a great girl.And the world deserves to know you."
"04","16","24","SUMMER","You deserve it, too."
"04","16","24","JULIE","Don't settle for comfortable."
"04","16","24","SUMMER","I got you something. I know she would have wanted to be here today."
"04","16","24","JULIE","Thank you. Thank you."
"04","16","24","SUMMER","Crap, my makeup."
"04","16","24","JULIE","Hmm, my makeup. It'll take hours to fix."
"04","16","24","GORDON","Hours? We don't got hours. We're getting married now."
"04","16","24","JULIE","Now? Is Kirsten here?"
"04","16","24","GORDON","Uh, about that... she dropped child up in San Fran. But lucky for her, there was a hell of a midwife standing by."
"04","16","24","JULIE","Kirsten had her baby?"
"04","16","24","GORDON","Yeah, and she said she was sorry that she couldn't be here. Now are you ready to get hitched?"
"04","16","24","JULIE","I can't get married without Kiki. She's my best friend. I'm sorry, but I'm not doing it without her."
"04","16","25","GORDON","One of you two wouldn't be a wedding planner would you?"
"04","16","26","JULIE","Let me see my flower girl."
"04","16","26","KIRSTEN","Julie?"
"04","16","26","SANDY","Are you a runaway bride?"
"04","16","26","RYAN","Wait a minute, does that mean that everybody came with you?"
"04","16","26","SETH","Can I talk to you?"
"04","16","26","RYAN","Do you have a minute?"
"04","16","27","TAYLOR","Okay, Ryan, what do you want to talk about?"
"04","16","27","RYAN","Well, I realized that when I talked to you yesterday on the phone, I may have been a little insensitive."
"04","16","27","TAYLOR","You? Never."
"04","16","27","RYAN","I also realize that if the Cohen's do move to Berkeley, we... we may never see each other again."
"04","16","27","TAYLOR","Hadn't really thought about it."
"04","16","27","RYAN","And when we do say good-bye, I wanted it to be as friends."
"04","16","27","TAYLOR","Friends. Sure. Ryan Atwood, mon ami, sounds terif."
"04","16","28","SETH","We're grandparents? Wow, that's, uh, that's amazing. Congratulations to Pancakes."
"04","16","28","SUMMER","Yeah. Don't you think it's kind of weird that we didn't even knowPancakes was pregnant?"
"04","16","28","SETH","Well, we're not going to win any parenting awards."
"04","16","28","SUMMER","I mean, we must have been pretty out of it to not even notice or care. I think we've been in kind of a..."
"04","16","28","SETH","Rut lately? Mm."
"04","16","28","SUMMER","Do you really think that we can spend the next four years like this?"
"04","16","28","SETH","Well, look, I'm a pretty skeptical guy. I don't really believe in signs, but... this one's pretty easy to read. It's very easy to read. Big letters."
"04","16","28","SUMMER","GEORGE?"
"04","16","28","SETH","You got to go, Summer."
"04","16","28","SUMMER","But what about us?"
"04","16","28","SETH","This is for us, okay? It's for both of us."
"04","16","29","JULIE","I, Julie Cooper, take you, Gordon Bullit..."
"04","16","29","GORDON","Oh, come on, Squirt!"
"04","16","29","KAITLIN","Frank?"
"04","16","29","JULIE","Frank? Frank?"
"04","16","29","FRANK","Kaitlin, hey, is your mom around?"
"04","16","29","KAITLIN","Yeah, she's kind of getting married right now."
"04","16","29","FRANK","That's what I was afraid of. Put me on speaker phone."
"04","16","29","KAITLIN","It took you long enough."
"04","16","29","FRANK","Julie! Julie, can you hear me?"
"04","16","29","JULIE","Frank, what are you doing?"
"04","16","29","FRANK","I love you, Julie, and I want tobe there for you, and our son."
"04","16","29","SUMMER","She's pregnant with Frank's baby?"
"04","16","29","TAYLOR","Who cares? This is so romantic."
"04","16","29","FRANK","Hello?"
"04","16","29","GORDON","Sorry, Frank, old buddy, we're having a hard time hearing you. Let's get on with the wedding."
"04","16","29","JULIE","I'm sorry, can... can I have a moment?"
"04","16","29","GORDON","Oh, that woman is like nailing Jell-O to the wall."
"04","16","30","KAITLIN","Mom ?"
"04","16","30","JULIE","Not now, Kaitlin. Mom's trying to figure out who to marry."
"04","16","30","KAITLIN","I know. Which is why whatever you decide, just make sure it's what you want... because this is forever."
"04","16","31","SANDY","You mean it? Thank you. You in?"
"04","16","31","KIRSTEN","Yeah."
"04","16","31","SANDY","The Cohens are moving to Berkeley. Sophie, you're home!"
"04","16","32","SANDY","We got to go, we got a lot of work to do."
"04","16","33","KAITLIN","Our kitchen is going to be so empty."
"04","16","33","JULIE","I know. I was kind of getting used to becoming a Cohen. My Sandy imitation was killer."
"04","16","33","JULIE","Well, it's just the two of us now."
"04","16","33","KAITLIN","Yeah. It's pretty awesome that you decided to stay single. But do we have a plan?"
"04","16","33","JULIE","Yeah, I was thinking we could go get mani-pedis, maybe a couple of Mystics."
"04","16","33","KAITLIN","I was talking about, like, a real plan. A life plan."
"04","16","33","JULIE","I know. The truth is, I don't. For the first time, I am going to figure out how to do this on my own."
"04","16","33","KAITLIN","You're not on your own. I could work retail, part-time at least."
"04","16","33","JULIE","We'll figure it out."
"04","16","33","KAITLIN","We're Coopers."
"04","16","33","JULIE","Oh, hey, Summer forgot her books. ""Undergraduate Catalog."""
"04","16","34","RYAN","All right, Roberts. I'll see you."
"04","16","34","SUMMER","See you, Atwood."
"04","16","34","RYAN","Thank you very much for Flapjacks. I promise I'll raise him right."
"04","16","34","SUMMER","Well, don't forget to clean his cage, which should not be used for cage fights."
"04","16","34","RYAN","Got it."
"04","16","34","TAYLOR","Oh, my gosh, I'm going to miss you so much."
"04","16","34","SUMMER","Well, you can follow up with my political efforts on my blog."
"04","16","34","TAYLOR","And you can follow my personal efforts on mine. You're the best. You're the only girlfriend I ever had. I'll miss you."
"04","16","34","SUMMER","You, too."
"04","16","34","RYAN","All right. We'll be in the car. Bye."
"04","16","35","SETH","I don't know, some of these GEORGE guys, they look so idealistic."
"04","16","35","SUMMER","You got nothing to worry about. Just remember, this isn't good-bye. You're my destiny, Cohen."
"04","16","35","SETH","Go save the world, Summer Roberts."
"04","16","35","SUMMER","See you in '08 after the New Hampshire primary."
"04","16","35","SETH","Just go."
"04","16","35","SUMMER","I'm going to go."
"04","16","36","TAYLOR","So you're going off to Berkeley, I'm going off to Paris. Who knows what's going to happen, huh?"
"04","16","36","RYAN","Yeah. Well, I think what's really important is what's already happened, which was this year, thank you, Taylor... you saved me."
"04","16","36","TAYLOR","Well, you may have helped me iron out a few issues of my own."
"04","16","36","RYAN","All right. Come here."
"04","16","36","RYAN","Remind me why you're taking the train to Paris."
"04","16","36","TAYLOR","Oh, actually, I'm taking a train to New York, and from there I'm taking a boat to Paris. It's the strangest thing, but no airline would have me. Oh, you'd better get going."
"04","16","36","RYAN","Oh, yeah, but..."
"04","16","36","TAYLOR","Ryan... better do that. Ryan. They're not going to let you off the train. Uh-oh."
"04","16","36","RYAN","Where's the next station?"
"04","16","36","TAYLOR","San Bernardino, I think. It's an hour away."
"04","16","36","RYAN","Ooh, we can do a lot in an hour."
"04","16","36","TAYLOR","I did book a sleeper car."
"04","16","37","SANDY","That's the last of it. Here we go."
"04","16","37","KIRSTEN","Fly safe and we'll see you at Parent's Day weekend."
"04","16","37","SETH","All right."
"04","16","37","SANDY","Two months and 14 days away."
"04","16","37","SETH","I will be counting the days as well."
"04","16","37","KIRSTEN","Oh, I love you."
"04","16","37","SETH","I love you, too. Let's group-hug it."
"04","16","37","SANDY","Well, I guess we'd better get going if we're going to beat the traffic. You take care of yourself. You got the directions in case we get separated?"
"04","16","37","RYAN","Yeah, you know what? I think I'm just going to hang out. As much as this house meant to you..."
"04","16","37","SANDY","Take your time. I'll meet you at the rest stop in Santa Barbara."
"04","16","37","RYAN","All right."
"04","16","37","KIRSTEN","Time to go!"
"04","16","37","SANDY","Yep."
"04","16","37","RYAN","I could give you a ride."
"04","16","37","SETH","No, no, this is better. My new life of loneliness and isolation begins now."
"04","16","37","RYAN","Ah, you're going to be fine."
"04","16","37","SETH","Yeah, I don't know about you though. I've been doing some checking up on your new roommate. His favorite book and movie are DaVinci Code. He's no me."
"04","16","37","RYAN","You say that like it's a bad thing."
"04","16","37","SETH","At least I leave you funnier than when I found you."
"04","16","37","RYAN","Yeah, I'm a lot better off than when you found me."
"04","16","37","SETH","Me, too."
"04","16","37","RYAN","Should we hug? I know. It's crazy."
"04","16","37","SETH","Come on. Give me a shake, dude."
"04","16","37","RYAN","All right."
"04","16","37","SETH","All right. Aw. feels good in here. Oh, it felt really nice. All right. See you later."
"04","16","37","RYAN","Yeah. All right."
"04","16","38","SETH","I don't know what to say, except that you totally had my back out there."
"04","16","38","KIRSTEN","Ryan's going to stay with us now."
"04","16","38","RYAN","I'll unpack later."
"04","16","39","SUMMER","Good job, you guys. Louder! Come on!"
"04","16","40","SANDY","All right, what was... I think you can pretty much imagine what I'm going to talk about. That's right. I hope you know what I'm talking about. All right! Any volunteers?"
"04","16","41","KAITLIN","X=24."
"04","16","42","RYAN","Yeah, I'm just leaving the site now. Everything looks good. We're on schedule to meet our target date. Thank you. Hey, kid. Need any help?"
