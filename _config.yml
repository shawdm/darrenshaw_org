  Hello! Darren Shaw here, a portrait photographer living and working around
  Southampton in Hampshire. I mainly shoot beauty and editorial work. As well
  as digital, I enjoy working with older film cameras and love soft, naturally
  lit black and white images. I’m always looking to meet new models, makeup
  artists and stylists. So if you’re interested in working together, get in
  touch.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://darrenshaw.org" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
