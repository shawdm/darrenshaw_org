Another shoot with Eric. Another chance for her to work those dimples. Although different from many of Eric's pictures I love that they give a sense of what it's like to be around her. I also love Eric's plaid trousers.

Even the highest-end fashion brands and magazines are subject to Instagram's influence. They've been drawn in to the  exaggerated, waxwork skin retouching common in filters. The more I see this trend, the more I love the grainy, blurry pictures that still make editorials. Photographers have done this for years but they stand out more today than ever. I don't often have the confidence to use this style but in this shoot they are by far my favourite pictures.
