There’s really only one thing you need to do with an Emma Watson photo - leave her freckles alone. Which is, of course, exactly what [Alasdair McLellan](https://www.instagram.com/alasdairmclellan) and [Lynsey Alexander](https://www.instagram.com/lynseyalexander/) did in this [Vogue UK picture](https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/emma-watson-december-issue-british-vogue-2019).

The image is almost monotone. I love that the tree, table, Burberry leopard print and Watson's makeup are all variations on the same colour. It’s like black and white for advanced photographers.

Watson has been able to do fashion shoots from day one, but I think she’s getting better. There’s always something happening in her eyes, avoiding the pictures looking too soft or pretty. She is also bringing the best brow game (outside of Eyebrows Delevingne) to town.
