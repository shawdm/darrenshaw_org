[Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody_Else_Is_Doing_It,_So_Why_Can%27t_We%3F)
and [No Need to Argue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Need_to_Argue) were the albums I listened to the most during the
early 1990s. Forget Jay-Z and The Beatles, it's [The Cranberries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cranberries) that
I'll always associate with the black album and the white album.
