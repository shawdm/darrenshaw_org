excerpt: Things I've been reading in February 2026 on technology, development and AI.

## Technology

1. [Exploiting McDonald's APIs](https://eaton-works.com/2024/12/19/mcdelivery-india-hack/) is an old post I've been
   meaning to read. Security vulnerability posts are often a bit dry, but this is a fun adventure in abusing APIs to get
   free McDonald's.
2. [The Story of Creative Technology](https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-story-of-creative-technology). Everyone who had
   a PC in the late 90s will be familiar with Creative's Sound Blaster. It's a company that has a very specific
   place in time.
3. While I'm feeling nostalgic, [Deluxe Paint on the Commodore Amiga](https://stonetools.ghost.io/deluxepaint-amiga/) is
   another way to reminisce about 90s computing.
4. Software Defined Radio is something I want to play with. [This](https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/) is an
   inspirational article on what you might do with it.
5. [The Toy Story You Remember](https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-toy-story-you-remember). There are lots of
   interesting things about the cross-over period between analogue and digital. This article is all about the
   colouring in the original Toy Story and why it looks weird now.

## Development

1. [Handling Exceptions in Kafka](https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/reference/kafka/annotation-error-handling.html).
   Not exciting but easy to get wrong and a good reference.
2. [Unexpected Things that are People](https://bengoldhaber.substack.com/p/unexpected-things-that-are-people). Lovely
   article about edge cases (or corner cases as I keep hearing people say).
3. [Craft software that makes people feel something](https://rapha.land/craft-software-that-makes-people-feel-something/).
   So many people
   reference [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild)
   in so many different contexts.

## AI

1. Everyone has been reading and discussing [Something Big Is Happening](https://shumer.dev/something-big-is-happening).
   It sounds feasible. The advice is good regardless of where AI goes (be good at learning new things). But it is
   another "this time it's different" article. I remember
   reading [this](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/robot-us-self-driving-trucks-coming-save-lives-kill-jobs/) Wired article
   about autonomous vehicles about to bring in the end of trucking as an accessible middle class job in the US. That
   was ten years ago, and it's as far away now as it was then. Maybe this will be different. Maybe it won't.
