excerpt: Things I've been reading on technology, development and AI.

## Technology

1. [Tech Predictions for 2026 and Beyond](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2025/11/tech-predictions-for-2026-and-beyond.html).
   The sort of writing Wired used to do at the intersection of technology and the real world. I read these predictions every
   year.
2. [For my 80th birthday I bought myself a new brain](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-80th-birthday-i-bought-myself-new-brain-jim-highsmith-8qcrc/).
   80-year-old experimenting on his own brain. Good stuff.

## Development

1. [OpenTelemetry with Spring Boot](https://spring.io/blog/2025/11/18/opentelemetry-with-spring-boot). Covers the
   difficult part about maintaining MDC context when switching threads.
2. [Architecture Patterns for Reliable Event-Driven Systems](https://dzone.com/articles/reliable-event-driven-architecture-patterns).
   Useful summary of the problems you eventually come across when working on event-based systems. We used this as the
   basis of an Architecture Kata at [work](https://careers.autotrader.co.uk).
3. [Handling Exceptions in Kafka Streams](https://www.baeldung.com/java-kafka-streams-exception-handling), [Effect of Idempotence on the Performance of a Kafka Producer](https://www.baeldung.com/java-kafka-idempotence-performance)
   and [Event-Driven Architecture Patterns](https://dzone.com/articles/event-driven-architecture-real-world-iot). Also
   related to above.
4. [Why Use the Returned Instance of Spring Data JPA Repository's save() Call](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-data-jpa-save-use-returned-instance).
   Or why JPA can cause more trouble than it's worth.

## Work

1. [On Factory Tours](https://www.scopeofwork.net/on-factory-tours/). I love a factory tour; it reminded me of school
   trips to [Sellafield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sellafield).
2. [Signals for 2026](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/signals-for-2026/). Generalists, or in this case "product builder"
   comes up year after year. We often use "full-stack" in an engineering-only context; it should be about solving a user's problem.

## AI

It's hard to read about AI because there's so much noise and hype. Here are some things I've read that I think are
worthwhile.

1. Tech CEOs don't seem to realise just how anti-human their AI fanaticism is
   from [PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/tech-ceos-dont-seem-to-realise-just-how-anti-human-their-ai-fanaticism-is-and-i-think-its-all-because-of-the-enlightenment).
2. What the computerisation of Wall Street can teach us about
   AI from [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/taming-the-delightful-chaos/).
3. [Teaching Large Language Models to Speak Spotify](https://research.atspotify.com/2025/11/teaching-large-language-models-to-speak-spotify-how-semantic-ids-enable).
   There's a lot of good content on Spotify's blog.
