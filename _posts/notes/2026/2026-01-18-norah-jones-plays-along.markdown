excerpt: Happy to stumble across Norah Jones' perfect, perfect podcast.

[Norah Jones Is Playing Along](https://www.norahjonesisplayingalong.com) is an unexpected favourite podcast. Her
interviews are warm and humble but the highlight is always when she plays and sings along with the guest. It's glorious.

Her duet with with Logic on 1-800-273-8255 is so good. Who can relate? Woooo!
