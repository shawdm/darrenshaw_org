excerpt: Romy's Mid Air album is underappreciated. I was sat on a beach in September 2023 when it was released. I had it on repeat for the whole holiday. There's not been a week since that I've not played it through.

Romy's [Mid Air](https://open.spotify.com/album/7vQRJ5q9b0c4gKrsh9yIhE) album is underappreciated. I was sat on a beach
in September 2023 when it was released. I had it on repeat for the whole holiday. There's not been a week since that
I've not played it through. 

I won't skip any, but [Love Her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6gGG7u0dbE) is my standout
track.
