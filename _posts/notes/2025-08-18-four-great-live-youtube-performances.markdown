Beyoncé's Irreplaceable at Glastonbury in 2011 for getting the crowd to do exactly what you want.

Phoebe Bridgers and Arlo Parks doing a Covid era performance of Radiohead's Fake Plastic Trees. This was the video

Little Simz' Venom. Flawless. Devastating.

Anne-Marie and Aitch having so much fun performing Psycho. Impossible to watch without smiling.
