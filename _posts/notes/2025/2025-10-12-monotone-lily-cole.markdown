![Lily Cole by Koray Birand](/images/notes/2025/lily-cole.avif)
The colours in this [Koray Birand](https://www.koraybirand.co.uk) image for a 2011 issue of Harper’s Bazaar Turkey are
so tight. Lily Cole’s hair and skin perfectly matching the tones of the red and brown bricks in the buildings. Even the
white of her coat match the window blinds and street markings.
