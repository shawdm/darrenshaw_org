I quite like Halsey's Badlands album, but the Live From Webster Hall version is on another level. So much intensity in
the crowd participation. Top 10 live album lists always have things like Johnny
Cash's [At San Quentin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_San_Quentin). Live From Webster Hall should be on those lists.
