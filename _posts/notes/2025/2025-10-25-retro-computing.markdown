excerpt: The Commodore 64C and Amiga 500 have a lot to answer for.

There's a new version of
a [Commodore 64](https://www.commodore.net/product-page/commodore-64-ultimate-basic-beige-batch1) which I won't be
buying. I do have nostalgia for the Commodore 64C and Amiga 500, being Christmas presents, my entry points into home
computing and everything I've done since. The original bundles I had can still be found on ebay.

The Commodore 64C Olympic Challenge pack was responsible for destroying multiple joysticks.

Lemmings and Deluxe Paint III are Amiga classics (not so much The Simpsons or Captain Planet).
