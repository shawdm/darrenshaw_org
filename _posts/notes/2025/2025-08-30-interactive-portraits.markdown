[Jeremy Cowart](https://www.jeremycowart.com)'s dynamic and interactive portraits. Why is there not more stuff like
this? I think it was MIT's Media Lab that had Harry Potter style interactive physical portraits at some point. I'm sure
there was a Wired article on them. It seems like it's been lost to the AI Google swamp.
