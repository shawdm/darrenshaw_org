Monotone pop star magazine covers? I loved the soft
pink [British Vogue July 2025](https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/editors-letter-british-vogue-july-2025) cover of Dua
Lipa. They also did something similar with her
in [February 2021](https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/dua-lipa-british-vogue-february-2021).

Much harder, but also pleasingly monotone are Charlie XCX and Troye
Sivan's [i-D covers](https://i-d.co/article/charli-xcx-troye-sivan-sweat-brat-tour-interview).
