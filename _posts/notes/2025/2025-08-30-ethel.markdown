[Fuck Me Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4h1rsPRwOg) is my favourite Ethel Cain track. It also has some of the
best lyrics in any song.

> She's no good at raising children, but she's good at raising Hell.

What a line. But then there's:

> In her mom's jeans that she cut to really show off her ass.
>
> She's got her makeup done, and her high heels on.
>
> She's got her hair up to God, she's gonna get what she wants.

And:

> She's scared of nothing but the passenger's side.
>
> Of some old man's truck in the dark parking lot.
