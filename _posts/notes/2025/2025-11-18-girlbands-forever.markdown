excerpt: All Saints and Mis-Teeq were my favourite groups in Girlbands Forever. Great late 90s music.

All Saints ("Hi. I'm Mel from the 90s") and Mis-Teeq were my favourite groups
in [Girlbands Forever](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/nov/01/girlbands-forever-review-bbc-all-saints-sugababes-eternal).

All Saints were always cooler than everyone else, "splish splash I was taking a bath...".

Pure Shores is one of the best pop songs of the 90s. It's got the same tingly William Orbit sound used in his remix of
Dice by Finley Quaye (which will always sounds like [The OC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_O.C.)).

Mel Blatt's Twentyfourseven with lots of Spanish guitar is a 90s lullaby.

Mis-Teeq are so much fun. It's easy to forget how good pre-celebrity Alesha Dixon's MCing is.
