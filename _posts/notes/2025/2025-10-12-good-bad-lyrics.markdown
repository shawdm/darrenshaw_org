My favourite good and bad lyrics.

## Take me up

> How was playing drums? Too much shit to carry.

Scott Street, Phoebe Bridgers


> I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man.

Diamonds From Sierra Leone (Remix), Kanye West and Jay Z

> Drop a album, drop a baby but I'll never drop the ball.

South of the Border, Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello and Cardi B


> My blood type's the 90s.

Someone sang this, which I think is a reference to Eminem and Royce Da 5'9", but Google is not helping me. I'll add this
in when I eventually remember who it was.

## Bring me down

> Do you ever feel like a plastic bag

Firework, Katy Perry

> Waking up diagonal like an animal

I Don't Care, Cheryl Cole. I can overlook this lyric as this is a bop with a fun video.
