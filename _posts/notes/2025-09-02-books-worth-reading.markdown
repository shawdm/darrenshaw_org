excerpt: Books I enjoyed reading during the Summer of 2025.

1. [The Holiday - T.M. Logan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41973359-the-holiday)
   I bought this in Tesco on a whim because I liked the cover and I'm susceptible to circular book club marketing
   stickers. I hoped it might be something like [Saint X](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43782399-saint-x). It's
   not. But it is a page turner and I finished it in three days.
2. [Children of Time - Adrian Tchaikovsky](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25499718-children-of-time) I wouldn't
   have bought this book if I knew it
   was going to be about giant space-traveling spiders. I was expecting a space drama
   like [The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22733729-the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet)
   but this is a book with something serious to say about AI, God, sexism, culture, global warming and
   pandemics. It was great.
3. [The Idea of You - Robinne Lee](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31450913) This book gets terrible reviews. People
   say it's Harry Styles fan fiction (missing the more interesting Cheryl/Liam angle). I loved it. It was silly but so
   much fun. There's a [film version](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9466114/) which Anne Hathaway is too beautiful and
   young-looking to make as interesting as the book.
