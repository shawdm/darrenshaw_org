I first came across Lainey Wilson via
a [13 year old in a barber's chair](https://www.tiktok.com/@theesingingbarber/video/7317038176185634094) which is also
awesome.

I love Alicia Keys' little giggle as she thinks about what's going to happen.

A young and harder sounding Phoebe Bridgers. I hear Dolores O'Riordan when she sings like this. What a voice.

So much fun.
