replayed [All About That Bass: How Pop Became Obsessed With The 808](https://www.20k.org/episodes/allaboutthatbass)
by [Twenty Thousand Hertz](https://www.20k.org). It's a great episode that reminded me of a
playlist [Alice](https://alicebartlett.co.uk) made a hundred years ago.

There was a point in early 2010's pop where you were required to shout-out the 808.

Boom! What is going on in this video?

An 808 is one of the instruments I've been playing with in [Strudel](https://strudel.cc/) (Javascript version
of [Tide Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org)) which can be used to live code music. I came across Strudel after
seeing
[DJ_Dave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcpWzhekEY) and working out how it was done
via [this tutorial](https://mirakl.tech/beats-bytes-and-basslines-an-introduction-to-live-coding-with-strudel-cc-4d378e86d5b7).

This is all the Internet I love.
