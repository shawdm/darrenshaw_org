I love photography, but it's just a hobby. It's not a side hussle or to make money from. I just like taking pictures and working to make them better. I'm not really a fashion, portrait or beauty photographer, I'm definitely not a story teller, but I'm best at taking pictures of people.

I got in to photography through Rankin and the pictures he made with Heidi Klum in the early 2000s. I've since grown to appreciate [Boo George](https://www.wschupfer.com/artists/boo-george-paris), [Norman Jean Roy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/t-magazine/breadfolks-norman-jean-roy.html), [Steven Meisel](https://www.artandcommerce.com/artists/photographers/Steven-Meisel) and especially [Peter Lindbergh](https://www.instagram.com/therealpeterlindbergh/). I sometimes [write](https://www.darrenshaw.org/blog/2019/11/24/gigi-hadid.html) about why I love thier pictures.

Away from photography I work as a software developer in the recommendations and search team at [Net-A-Porter](https://www.net-a-porter.com). I sometimes [write](https://medium.com/ynap-tech/the-colour-of-net-a-porter-and-mr-porter-1667a05a8b7d) about that too.
