    ### Wimbledon (2017)
    Technical lead and developer for "WhatMakesGreat", a project using machine learning with structured and unstructured data to understand what makes a great Wimbledon champion. The output of this project was used in articles for The Telegraph, Wimbledon's Facebook page, digital advertising at Heathrow airport, print newspapers and IBM's marketing campaign.

    Technology Used: Watson Discovery Service, Watson Personality Insights, NodeJS, DB2, Cloud Foundry/Bluemix.

    ### RBS Hybrid Chat Bot Prototype (2016)
    Lead developer for the chat user interface. The interesting challenge was to avoid the transition between bot and human being seamless, but still remain smooth. Research indicated that users want to know if they are talking to a human or machine.

    Technology Used: Watson Conversation, LiveChat, NodeJS, Javascript, Cloud Foundry/Bluemix.

    ### US Masters, Roland Garros, ABM Amro, Wimbledon (2016)
    Technical lead and developer for a real-time social media analytics system. A machine learning classifier was used to identify content relevant to each tournament and natural language processing to understand the text. At peak, the system analysed 400 messages per second. It was used by the four tournaments to direct their social media output.

    Technology Used: Watson Natural Language Classifier, Alchemy Language API, Apache Spark, NodeJS, Java, Cloud Foundry/Bluemix.

    ### Wimbledon (2015)
    Technical lead and developer for an AI chat bot. The bot was capable of answering both statistical questions ("how many French players made the second round in 1999?") and questions that needed to be answered from unstructured data ("how do Wimbledon keep the pigeons away?"). Machine learning allowed the bot to answer unstructured data queries, combined with research technology (Controlled English) to answer structured data queries.

    Technology Used: Watson Engagement Advisor, Controlled English, NodeJS, DB2, Cloud Foundry/Bluemix.

    ### Shop Direct Fantasy Fashion (2013)
    Technical lead and mentor for an Extreme Blue project to prototype a fantasy fashion game for Shop Direct's "Very" brand. The project allowed customers to predict fashion trends, increasing time spent browsing Very's catalogue, promoting social sharing and providing Shop Direct with data that could be used to predict future sales.

    Technology Used: PHP, MySQL.

    ### Meedan (2009)
    Technical lead for Meedan's social network, using statistical machine translation to facilitate discussion between native English and Arabic speakers. Meedan was an early social network and the first to make use of machine translation. It allowed users to correct translations, improving both the site and the underlying machine translation algorithms, pre-dating the same approach Google use.

    Technology Used: PHP, MySQL, IBM Research Machine Translation.

I'm a technical lead and developer in IBM's Emerging Technology group with 16 years' experience of taking research through to proof of concept and production systems. I've been responsible for the delivery of projects for **Wimbledon**, **Roland Garros**, **The US Open**, **RBS**, **Shop Direct** and **Homebase**.

I have a reputation for being pragmatic and making things work on difficult projects in high pressure situations, leading many of IBM's sports event innovation projects since 2013. I enjoy mentoring colleagues through these projects.

As an early adopter of IBM's version of the Design Thinking process I ran the first prototype workshops with UK clients. I've since run workshops for: **Universal Music**, **Unilever**, **KPMG**, **Carphone Warehouse**, **Wimbledon**, **EDF**, **British Gas** and **Stop the Traffik**.

I contribute most when I'm part of the full scope of a project: from problem, through ideas generation, development and to delivery. I'm as happy giving pitches, working with the business, generating ideas or being heads down in code.


## Technology
Javascript, NodeJS, Java, PHP, CSS, Apache Spark, Elasticsearch, DB2, MySQL, Postgres, IBM Watson Machine Learning, IBM Discovery, IBM Conversation, CouchDB/Cloudant, Cloud Foundry, Bluemix, Photoshop, Sketch.

I am able to pick up new technology quickly, particularly when it is at an immature stage.


## What Else?
I'm a (still learning) [fashion and portrait photographer](https://www.darrenshaw.org). I've been published in The Guardian, BBC Online, Hampshire Life, Guys+Girls, HairstylesOnly and I shot a cover of HairNow. I   [write](https://medium.com/why-i-love-this-picture) about photographs I love.
