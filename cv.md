# Darren Shaw
*Technical Lead and Full Stack Developer*

## Profile
I'm a technical lead and developer in IBM's Emerging Technology group. I have 16 years experience in taking ideas and research projects through to proof of concept and production systems. I've been responsible for the successful delivery of innovation projects for **Wimbledon**, **Roland Garros**, **The US Open**, **RBS**, **Shop Direct** and **Homebase**.

I've gained a reputation for making things work on difficult projects in pressure situations, leading many of IBM's sports event innovation projects since 2013. An unexpectedly enjoyable part of this work has been the opportunity to mentor colleagues though these projects.


## Skills
The technical skills required on emerging technology projects have changed dramatically (**Javascript**, **NodeJS**, **Java**, **PHP**, **CSS**, **DB2**, **MySQL**, **Postgres**, **IBM Watson Machine Learning**, **Apache Spark**), but I've developed the ability to learn new technology quickly, particularly at a stage where it is unreliable and with little or no documentation.

The ability to work both with a customer (presenting project pitches, running design thinking workshops, writing bids) and the development team (design, code and project management) across the full scope of a project is something I enjoy.


## 2001-2017 IBM Emerging Technology
### Wimbledon 2017
Technical lead and developer for #WhatMakesGreat project, creating a machine learning based application to judge what makes a great Wimbledon champion. The output of this project was used in articles for The Telegraph, Wimbledon's Facebook page, digital advertising at Heathrow airport and in-print newspapers. The analysis produced was highlighted by Martina Navratalova and Marion Bartoli.  
Technology Used: Watson Discovery Service, Watson Personality Insights, DB2, NodeJS.

### RBS Hybrid Chat Bot Prototype
Lead developer for the chat bot UI, allowing the integration of bot and human customer assistance. The interesting challenge in this project was to not make the integration seamless. Transferring a customer from a bot to a human should not be jarring, but it needed to be clear to the customer who they were talking to.
Technology Used: Watson Conversation, LiveChat, NodeJS, Javascript.

### US Masters, Roland Garros, ABM Amro, Wimbledon 2016
Technical lead and developer for Machine Leaning based social media analytics system.  Machine learning based classifier used to identify content on social media relavant to each tournament.
Technology Used: Watson Natural Language Classifier, Alchemy Language API, Apache Spark, NodeJS, Java

### Shop Direct
Technical lead and mentor for an Extreme Blue project to implement a fantasy fashion game for Shop Direct on their very.co.uk brand.
Technology Used: PHP, MySQL

### Homebase
Technical lead and mentor

### Wimbledon 2015
Technical lead and developer for Watson AI based chat bot.  The bot was capable of answering both stats based questions that could be answered from a relational database ("how many French players made the second round in 1999?") and questions that needed to be answered from unstructured data ("how do they keep the pigeons away?"). Machine Learning (Watson Enagagment Advisor) used to train bot to answer unstructured data queries, combined wit Controlled English to answer structrued data queries.
Technology Used: Watson Engagement Advisor, DB2, NodeJS

### Wimbledon 2013-2014

### UK Intelligence Agency
Lead developer on a project to construct scale free social networks from unstructured data and perform network analysis to determine influence of each node.  As a result of the project I was granted a patent based on the algortihm and contributed a chapter to the book xxx on using the software for network analysis.
Technology Used: Java, DB2, Intelligent Miner for DB2

### UK Home Office / Police


### Design Thinking
I've run Design Thinking workshops for: Instrumental, Unilever, Shroders, KPMG, Carphone Warehouse, Wimbledon, EDF, British Gas, Stop the Traffik



## 1998-2001 IBM UK
Sponsored by IBM while at University. I was a technical specicialist working on the delivery of Tivoli based systems management projects.



I'm responsible for taking problems, through design, development and in to production or prototype applications, encompassing both hands on development and project management roles.

A project in Emerging Technology typically lasts less than three months. Each project often uses a different technology and requires new technical and non-technical skills. This means i that I've become adept at picking up new skills quickly, whether they be building on research level natural language technology (Controlled English), running Design Thinking workshops for clients, producing statistics for journalists, or painting sensors Wimbledon green.

I am adept at pickup up new skills quickly, whether they be technical, business, management or practical.

I'm responsible for mentoring junior colleagues though difficult projects. While originally something I struggled with, I've found a way to make it work enough that its become a part of projects I enjoy and am recognised for.

I've presented work to technical and non-technical audiences.

## Opinions
I believe that a successful innovation project is dependent on identifying the key problems that needs to be solved, being open to other peoples ideas, tackling the difficult parts early and finding a way to communicate what has been achieved.
