## Profile
I'm a technical lead and developer in IBM's Emerging Technology group. I have 16 years experience in taking ideas and research projects through to proof of concept and production systems. I've been responsible for the successful delivery of innovation projects for **Wimbledon**, **Roland Garros**, **The US Open**, **RBS**, **Shop Direct** and **Homebase**.

I've gained a reputation for making things work on difficult projects in pressure situations, leading many of IBM's sports event innovation projects since 2013. An unexpectedly enjoyable part of this work has been the opportunity to mentor colleagues though these projects.

*Something about full stack all aspects of projects here*

## 2001-2017 IBM Emerging Technology
### Wimbledon (2017)
Technical lead and developer for 'WhatMakesGreat' a project to judge what makes a great Wimbledon champion using machine learning with structured and unstructured data. The output of this project was used in articles for The Telegraph, Wimbledon's Facebook page, digital advertising at Heathrow airport, print newspapers and IBM's marketing campaign.
Technology Used: Watson Discovery Service, Watson Personality Insights, NodeJS, DB2, Cloud Foundary/Bluemix

### RBS Hybrid Chat Bot Prototype (2016)
Lead developer for the chat user interface. The interesting challenge was to avoid the transition between bot and human being seamless, but remain smooth. Research suggested that users want to know if they are talking to a human or machine.
Technology Used: Watson Conversation, LiveChat, NodeJS, Javascript, Cloud Foundary/Bluemix

### US Masters, Roland Garros, ABM Amro, Wimbledon (2016)
Technical lead and developer for a machine leaning based real time social media analytics system. A machine learning classifier was used to identify content relevant to each tournament. Keywords as a means for selecting  content had proved unsatisfactory because of the almost random topics that are discussed in the context of a sports event. At peak, the system analysed 400 messages per second in real-time.
Technology Used: Watson Natural Language Classifier, Alchemy Language API, Apache Spark, NodeJS, Java, Cloud Foundary/Bluemix

### Wimbledon (2015)
Technical lead and developer for an AI based chat bot. The bot was capable of answering both stats based questions ("how many French players made the second round in 1999?") and questions that needed to be answered from unstructured data ("how do they keep the pigeons away?"). Machine learning (Watson Engagement Advisor) was used to train bot to answer unstructured data queries, combined with research technology (Controlled English)   to answer structured data queries.
Technology Used: Watson Engagement Advisor, Controlled English, NodeJS, DB2, Cloud Foundary/Bluemix

### Design Thinking (2014-2017)
I've lead Design Thinking workshops and projects since 2014. I piloted the technique in the Emerging Technology UK group in 2014. I adapted the process and lead the first Design Thinking workshops in the UK with IBM clients.
I've run Design Thinking workshops for: Instrumental, Unilever, Shroders, KPMG, Carphone Warehouse, Wimbledon, EDF, British Gas, Stop the Traffik.

### Shop Direct Fantasy Fashion (2013)
Technical lead and mentor for an Extreme Blue project to implement a fantasy fashion game for Shop Direct on their very.co.uk brand.
Technology Used: PHP, MySQL

### Homebase
Technical lead and mentor for an Extreme Blue project to manage click and collect orders, providing a better customer experience and a simpler process for employees.
Technology Used: NodeJS, Javascript, Ionic

## Skills
Javascript, NodeJS, Java, PHP, CSS, DB2, MySQL, Postgres, IBM Watson Machine Learning, Apache Spark, Cloud Foundary, Bluemix.

I have the capacity to learn new technology quickly, particularly at a stage where it is unreliable and with little or no documentation.

The ability to work both with a customer (presenting project pitches, running design thinking workshops, writing bids) and the development team (design, code and project management) across the full scope of a project is something I enjoy.  *Need to write this in a better way*

## Awards and Publications
### 23 Patents Issued
Including IBM High Value Patent award for "*Cooperative non-repudiated message exchange in a network environment*" a verifiable shared chat transcription log.

### Best Fan Engagement - 2016 Sports Technology Awards
IBM and Wimbledon won against strong competition from the Rugby World Cup and European Golf Tour. The Cognitive Social Command Centre I led the development on was referenced in the reasons for the award.

### Hermes Creative Award 2017 - Best Use of User Generated Content
Watson Poet - I was the lead developer for an AI based system that wrote poems out of social media messages written about 6 Nations rugby matches.

### Alsbridge Innvoation Award
Very on Trend won

### Best use of Social Media - 2015 BT Sports Industry Awards
Wimbledon 2015 won

### Building a 'living database' for human-machine intelligence analysis
Joint author on a paper presented at Fusion 2015 conference.
