I get butterflies looking at Peter Lindbergh's picture of Cara Delevingne. It was always going to be a beautiful portrait of a beautiful women, but Cara’s hard to read emotion, the simplicity of the lighting, pared back makeup and styling make it timeless.

## Why I Love This Picture
I love this picture because of Cara's face. There’s so much going on with her expression. The picture reveals more emotion the longer you spend with it. Initially she looks fierce, but as your eyes move across her face you notice the raised eyebrow and twinkle in Cara's eyes. Look again and she seems vulnerable, on the edge of tears, but then she’s back, via bored, to fierce and then as if she might smile, or perhaps burst in to tears. It’s relentless.

Cara Delevingne may be single-handedly responsible for changing brows. Five years ago if you saw a picture of her it was all boyish good looks and huge eyebrows. Everyone has Cara brows now - you don’t even notice them, but the originals are still the best.

Cara's versatility means she has done it all, from high concept Vogue editorials, to commercial billboards. For me, her best pictures are the ones where she’s able to bring out her personality and playfulness. There’s no other model who does this so consistently. Whether it's in TAG Heuer’s “Don’t Crack Under Pressure” campaign or the selfie shot for Vogue, with Cara, it's believable. You get the sense that Cara really doesn't care how she looks, she's just having fun. I don't think the Tag Heuer or Vogue pictures were planned exactly like they came out. If she was bothered about looking pretty they wouldn't have got such awesome pictures.

Peter Lindbergh’s pictures are some of fashions most identifiable. He’s known for telling stories through single cinematic frames (a lot of people credit him with being the first fashion photographer to do this).

Lindbergh took one of the fashion’s most well known pictures - the launch of supermodels\*.  His style has been pretty consistent since then, not taken in by fads or distractions. Black and white, stripped back and naturally lit, all of Lindbergh’s pictures follow a similar pattern. They’re real, without props or gimmicks, he doesn’t stray into anything experimental or “arty”. This picture is slightly unusual, Cara’s wings are something you’d normally find in a Paolo Roversi picture, rather than a Lindbergh one. Maybe it was a commercial decision by [the company who the picture was for]. Maybe he thought they added depth (they add a layer between foreground and background). Or Maybe Cara just thought they looked cool and there was no arguing. The picture would be just as good without them, but they don’t detract from it either.

Lindbergh's picture of Cara Delevingne goes all the way back to his 1994 bare faced portrait of Kate Moss. The lighting, style and even pose in this quarter of a century old pictures is almost identical to his Cara Delevingne picture. Minimal makeup is in style in 2018, but this is something Peter Lindbergh has always done. It's part of why his pictures don't age. Makeup styles change and can date a picture. With Lindbergh, you know what you’re going to get. Despite everything changing around him in terms of fashion and technology he’s still shooting like he did 30 years ago and is still the best at it.

\* It should not come as a surprise - but how much does 1990 Cindy Crawford look like 2018 Kaia Gerber.

## \*Photography Nerd Notes
Lindbergh shoots digitally, but by keeping the lighting simple and minimising the amount of retouching he maintains the black and white film look.

Lindbergh’s pictures look like they're indirectly lit with sunlight. It’s a forgiving lighting setup that makes anyone look good, never mind a super model. His pictures tend to minimise gender, they’re never particularly glamorous or sexy. His male and female subjects are often styled similarly. There’s no gimmicks in his pictures, but that gives him nowhere to hide. His pictures are about his relationship with the model.

Lindbergh’s are lightly retouched, you get creases, eye bags, spots, freckles. They’re real and though this is very of the moment, his pictures have always been this way.  Though Cara has makeup in this picture its lightly done. A lot of his pictures the models have no or hardly any makeup. It often makes a familiar face look different and exciting again.
