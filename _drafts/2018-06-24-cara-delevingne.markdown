I get butterflies looking at Peter Lindbergh's portrait of Cara Delevingne. It was always going to be a beautiful picture of a beautiful women, but Cara’s hard to read emotion and the simplicity of the lighting and styling make it timeless.

## Why I Love This Picture
There’s so much going on with Cara's expression. The picture shows more emotion the longer you look at it. Initially she looks fierce, but as your eyes across her face you notice the raised eyebrow and twinkle in Cara's eyes. Look again and she seems vulnerable, on the edge of tears, but then she’s back, via bored, to fierce and then like she’s about to smile, or burst in to tears. It’s relentless.

Cara Delevingne may be single-handedly responsible for changing brows. Five years ago if you saw a picture of her it was all boyish good looks and huge eyebrows. Everyone in fashion has Cara brows now - you don’t even notice them.

Cara is endlessly versatile, from high concept Vogue editorial shoots, to commercial billboards, she does it all. For me, her best pictures are the ones where she’s able to bring her personality and playfulness in. There’s no other models at her level able to do this so consistently.  Whether that’s in TAGHeur’s “Don’t Crack Under Pressure” campaign or the selfie shot for Vogue. With Cara it's believable and authentic.

Peter Lindbergh’s pictures are some of fashions most easily identifiable, he’s known for telling stories through single cinematic frames (a lot of people credit him with being the first fashion photographer to do this).

Lindberg took one of the fashion’s most well known pictures - the lauch of supermodels\*.  His style has been pretty consisitent since then, not taken in by fads or distractions. Black and white, stripped back and naturally lit, all of Lindergh’s pictures follow a similar pattern. They’re real, without props or gimmicks, he doesn’t stray into anything experimental or “arty”. This picture is slightly unusual, Cara’s wings are something you’d normally find in a Paolo Rovers picture, rather than a Lindbergh one. Maybe it was a commercial decision by [the company who the picture was for]. The picture would be just as good without them, but they don’t detract from it either.

Lindbergh's picture of Cara Delevingne goes all the way back to his 1994 portrait of Kate Moss. The lighting, style and even pose in this quarter of a century old pictures is almost  identical to his Cara Delevingne picture. It’s fair to say with Lindbergh, you know what you’re going to get, but despite everything changing around him in terms of fashion and technology he’s still at the top.

\* It should not come as a surprise - but how much does 1990 Cindy Crawford look like 2018 Kaia Gerber.

## \*Photography Nerd Notes
Lindbergh shoots digitally, but by keeping the lighting simple and minimising the amount of retouching he he keeps the black and white film look.

Lindbergh’s pictures are always look naturally lit. It’s a forgiving lighting setup that makes anyone look good, never mind a super model. They tend to minimise gender, they’re never particularly glamorous or sexy. There’s no gimmicks in his pictures - he can’t hide in the pictures, it’s all about his relationship with the model.

Like most timeless pictures, Lindbergh’s are lightly retouched, you get creases, eye bags, spots, freckles. They’re real and though this is very of the moment, his pictures have always been this way.  Though Cara has makeup in this picture its lightly done.  A lot of his pictures the models have no or hardly any makeup. It often makes a familiar face look different and exciting again, like his Naomi Campbell pictures.
