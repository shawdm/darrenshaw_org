        I'm Darren Shaw, a software developer at Net-A-Porter, which I've occasionally <a href="https://medium.com/ynap-tech/the-colour-of-net-a-porter-and-mr-porter-1667a05a8b7d">written</a> about. 
     </p>
     <p>
        I also play at being a <a href="/photography">portrait photographer</a> - but it's just a hobby. I love the photographs of Boo George, Norman Jean Roy, Steven Meisel and especially Peter Lindbergh. I sometimes <a href="https://www.darrenshaw.org/blog/2019/11/24/gigi-hadid.html">write</a> about why I like their pictures. I do test shoots, so if you're interested in working together please get in <a href="mailto:shawdm@gmail.com">touch</a>.
